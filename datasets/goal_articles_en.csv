1,"Messi is a footballing God! Argentina winners, losers & ratings as Leo carries Scaloni's side into World Cup quarter-finals",Lionel Scaloni's side edged past Australia to set-up a mouth-watering meeting with the Netherlands - and their No.10 was at his devastating best.," Lionel Messi has his first goal in the knockout stage of a World Cup, and boy was it a crucial one, with the Argentina captain breaking the deadlock out of nowhere in a hard-fought 2-1 win over Australia. Up until that point, the Socceroos had frustrated the life out of the Argentina fans, who once again took over nearly an entire stadium here in Qatar. They had come to see Lionel Messi mark the 1000th game of his incredible career with another masterclass, and they eventually got one, but, for the first 35 minutes, pretty much nothing happened. The No.10 was quickly surrounded by yellow shirts every time he received the ball and he struggled to impose himself on the proceedings. Nobody else in an Argentine shirt looked like making a breakthrough either.  If history has taught us anything, though, it's that Messi only needs a split second to score, and that's precisely what he did, reacting first to what looked more like a loose touch than a lay-off from Nicolas Otamendi.  That lethal left foot took care of the rest, with the Paris Saint-Germain star simply passing the ball into the bottom corner of the Australia net. Julian Alvarez then took advantage of a shocking mistake from Mathew Ryan to make it 2-0 and although Australia set up a tense finale courtesy of a speculative shot from Craig Goodwin that deflected in off Enzo Fernandez, Argentina held on thanks to a terrific late block from Lisandro Martinez, and a fine stop from namesake Emiliano. Below, GOAL breaks down the winners, losers and ratings from another memorable night for Messi's Argentina..."

10,Cristiano Ronaldo vs Lionel Messi: Who is better and is the GOAT in football? The stats head-to-head showdown,"A serious discussion point on five-a-side pitches and barstools across the world, the issue of which player is the greatest of all time persists"," Cristiano Ronaldo versus Lionel Messi - who is the GOAT?¬†It is the biggest conundrum in football since the 'Diego Maradona or Pele?' debate. The question of who is better between the Portuguese phenomenon and the empyrean Argentine has dominated the minds of football fans everywhere for the past decade and will persist¬†into the future. Club and national loyalties can cloud judgement on the matter, while personalities also play a part in how good a player is perceived to be, and most people know who they'd pick. So who really is the greatest of all time? Never mind who you prefer, GOAL has taken a look at how the pair actually shape up head-to-head so you can be fully armed with facts in the eternal argument.¬† On this page Cristiano Ronaldo vs Lionel Messi: Club goals Ronaldo has scored more club goals than Messi, but only just and it should be noted that the Manchester United star benefits from¬†having played two more seasons than his Argentine nemesis thus far. Each of them has¬†remarkably¬†netted over 690 club goals in their career so far, with the five seasons between 2009-10 and 2014-15 proving particularly golden as they pushed each other to greater heights. While Ronaldo currently has more goals overall, Messi has the edge in the scoring department, with a higher season average (37.9¬†to 35), having hit a high of 73 goals in 2011-12, though his average dropped after a disappointing maiden campaign at PSG in 2021-22. Ronaldo's highest season return was 61, which he achieved in 2014-15, and he surpassed the 50-goal mark every season for six years between 2010-11 and 2015-16. Interestingly, while Ronaldo's¬†seasonal totals have declined somewhat in recent years - he failed to break the 30-goal mark in 2018-19 during his first season at Juventus - Messi's have remained consistent, though the Argentine's rate slowed after joining PSG. Cristiano Ronaldo vs Lionel Messi: Club assists (Opta) When it comes to assists, Messi is much superior to Ronaldo and that contrast has become increasingly stark as their respective roles evolve. The fact that Messi creates so many goals as well as scoring them is a major consideration when deciding which player is the GOAT and, while Ronaldo chips in with his fair share, the difference in this particular realm is stark. Cristiano Ronaldo vs Lionel Messi: Champions League¬†stats *As of Champions League games played in 2022-23. Ronaldo is the all-time leading goalscorer in the Champions League, having shone in the competition with Manchester United and Real Madrid in particular. However, Messi isn't far behind and actually has a fractionally better goal-per-game ratio, so there is a good chance that he could overtake the Man United man if he continues to sparkle¬†in the competition . Ronaldo also holds the record for most overall Champions League appearances, having overtaken Iker Casillas. Cristiano Ronaldo vs Lionel Messi: World Cup stats When it comes to World Cups, Ronaldo and Messi are considered underperformers due to the simple fact that neither has won the competition. Portugal star Ronaldo¬†has scored more goals at the tournament and in fewer appearances, but Messi can claim to have gone furthest, having reached the final with Argentina in 2014. The PSG attacker won the Golden Ball during that tournament, despite missing out on the ultimate glory at the hands of Germany. The furthest Ronaldo reached with Portugal was the Selecao's run to the semi-final in 2006, when¬†they were beaten by France before losing the third-place play-off against Germany. Cristiano Ronaldo vs Lionel Messi: International stats Ronaldo and Messi have similar records at international level, though Ronaldo boasts greater numbers, partly because his senior Portugal career kicked off two years before Messi's with Argentina. Ronaldo equalled¬†Ali Daei's record of 109 international goals at Euro 2020 and then surpassed it with two goals against the Republic of Ireland, becoming¬†the top international goalscorer of all time. Messi is a long way behind Ronaldo in that respect, though he is by some distance Argentina's top goalscorer of all time, surpassing the great Gabriel Batistuta some years ago. Cristiano Ronaldo vs Lionel Messi: Titles    *National Cups refers to the main national cup competition in a country only, e.g. the FA Cup, Copa del Rey etc. Messi and Ronaldo have very similar trophy hauls, but Messi edges things when it comes to league titles, having won La Liga 10 times with Barcelona. Ronaldo has seven league titles, but unlike Messi, he can claim to have won the league in three different countries (England, Spain and Italy) - something that increases his claim to the GOAT crown in the eyes of some. Ronaldo has an edge over Messi in the Champions League, his love affair with the competition earning him the moniker 'Mr Champions League'. The Manchester United star¬†has also enjoyed notable success on the international stage with Portugal, winning the European Championship and the UEFA Nations League. Messi, on the other hand, has endured considerable heartache with Argentina, with four unsuccessful Copa¬†America campaigns, three of which saw them lose in the final. He finally got his hands on the Copa in 2021, before going to win the 2022 Finalissima. While neither has won the World Cup, Messi has an Olympic gold medal. Cristiano Ronaldo vs Lionel Messi: Individual awards The individual battle between Ronaldo and Messi has been the¬†defining feature of modern football for the past decade and more. Messi went ahead of Ronaldo in the Ballon d'Or stakes when he won his sixth in 2019 and cemented his superior status in that field with his seventh in 2021. Ronaldo does boast more of FIFA's new 'The Best' awards and has been crowned UEFA¬†Player of the Year on more occasions, but Messi has won more league Player of the Year accolades. Of course, it must be said that Ronaldo has won the Player of the Year award in England, Spain and Italy. Messi has got his hands on the European Golden Shoe¬†a record six times, which is two more than¬†Ronaldo, and is marginally ahead of his rival overall, but the fact that both have been on the FIFPro World XI 14¬†times is an illustration of how closely fought the battle has been.

11,"How many goals has Lionel Messi scored for Argentina? Albiceleste star's full World Cup, Copa America and international friendly record",The Argentine has been banging in the goals for his country ever since opening his account in 2005," Lionel Messi is not just one of the best creators of chances around in the game, but he is lethal in front of goal himself as well. The Paris Saint-Germain star is Argentina's all-time leading goal scorer by some distance and holds numerous other goalscoring records, both at club and international level. For the national team, it all started with a tumultuous debut appearance against Hungary in 2005, with Messi receiving a red card barely a minute after coming off the bench. That was merely a blip on his journey to greatness, though, and the forward got his first Argentina goal at senior level in a 3-2 friendly loss against Croatia the following year. That turned out to be start of an impressive goalscoring run and Messi has since been able to celebrate goals more or less wherever he went.

The American head coach claimed that there was little to split the two sides, and pointed towards a particular Barcelona forward who made the difference on the day. WHAT THEY SAID: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have a Memphis Depay right now, who‚Äôs scoring in the Champions League,"" Berhalter proclaimed, despite Memphis never scoring a Champions League goal since joining Barcelona. ‚Äú[The Netherlands] were clinical in their [scoring] opportunities in the first half. Other than that, there wasn‚Äôt much separating the teams.‚Äù THE BIGGER PICTURE: The USMNT scored just three goals in four World Cup matches, with Jesus Ferreira becoming their third striker to get the nod up top against the Netherlands. He too failed to make any meaningful contributions, though, and was substituted at half time for Gio Reyna. IN THREE PHOTOS: DID YOU KNOW? Memphis scored his 43rd international goal for the Netherlands, making him the player with the outright second-most goals for the Oranje behind Robin van Persie (50). WHAT NEXT FOR MEMPHIS? While Berhalter and the USMNT are heading home from Qatar, Memphis and the Netherlands progress to the quarter-finals, where the team will go on to face either Argentina or Australia.

22,Argentina vs Australia : Lineups and LIVE updates,Argentina prepare to face Australia in a jaw-dropping round of 16 fixture," Argentina and Lionel Messi continue their hunt for the biggest prize in football but face a resilient Australian outfit in a mouth-watering round of 16 clash in Qatar.  After overcoming a poor outing against Saudi Arabia, Argentina managed to win their remaining fixtures against Mexico and Poland to secure a round of 16 ticket. La Albiceleste would now like to continue their winning streak and defeat Australia to continue their quest for glory.  Once again all eyes would be on Lionel Messi to guide Argentina to victory with a scintillating performance. Another positive for Argentina would be that they have defeated Australia in their previous 4 meetings, a streak Lionel Scaloni would want his squad to continue. Considering the gulf in quality between the two outfits, it would be a competitive fixture for the Australian team. The Socceroos surprised the world when they secured qualification from a competitive group. But despite the difference in stature, the Qatar World Cup has already witnessed some massive results and Australia could surely shock the world by beating Argentina. Argentina XI (4-3-3): E. Martinez; Molina, Otamendi, Romero, Acuna; Mac Allister, Fernandez, De Paul; Alvarez, Messi, Papu Gomez Australia XI (4-4-2): Ryan; Degenek, Souttar, Rowles, Behich; Leckie, Mooy, Irvine, Baccus; McGree, Duke  The winner of this round of 16 encounter will face Netherlands in the Quarter finals in Qatar.

His Netherlands side are the first to book their place in the World Cup quarter-finals, after a hard-fought 3-1 win over the USA in Doha.  Goals from Memphis Depay, Daley Blind and the brilliant Denzel Dumfries did the damage for the Dutch, with substitute Haji Wright's strike little consolation for the Americans, who paid the price for a sluggish first-half showing. Not that Van Gaal and his side will care about that, of course. Finalists in 2010 and semi-finalists in 2014, the Oranje will fancy their chances of another deep run here.  They await the winners of Saturday night's Argentina versus Australia clash, and with Memphis and Dumfries in this kind of form, and having conceded only two goals in four games at the tournament so far, they will take some beating.

24,Berhalter: USMNT progressed towards international respectability at World Cup despite Netherlands loss,USMNT coach Gregg Berhalter highlighted the positives after his side bowed out of the World Cup with a 3-1 defeat to the Netherlands on Saturday.," WHAT HAPPENED? Goals from Memphis Depay, Daley Blind and Denzel Dumfries cancelled out an unusual strike from Haji Wright as the USMNT was eliminated from the last 16 of the tournament. Berhalter was quick to point towards the bigger picture for his side, highlighting the role of the team's identity, commitment and togetherness in its progress on the world stage. WHAT THEY SAID: ""We made some progress [in proving the United States can compete on world stage],"" Berhalter said to FOX. ""When people look at our team, they see a clear identity, players who fight for each other on the field. It's really special to see, you don't often get a bond like that."" THE BIGGER PICTURE: While the USMNT failed to reach what would have been its first quarter-final since 2002, Berhalter's quotes reflect a more rounded focus on the national team's long-term plan. Many of his players were featuring in their first ever World Cup in Qatar, meaning Saturday's exit will provide them with valuable experience moving forward to the 2026 finals hosted by the U.S. alongside Canada and Mexico. IN THREE PHOTOS:  DID YOU KNOW? At 25 years and 77 days, Berhalter fielded the youngest average starting XI of all teams in the tournament, with Ecuador (25y, 364d) and Spain (26y, 64d) the next youngest. WHAT NEXT FOR THE USMNT? Berhalter's side will have time to regroup and reflect before its next competitive fixture on March 24 against Grenada in the CONCACAF Nations League. Which was the best World Cup winning team?

25,"USMNT put in its place: Winners, losers & ratings as superior Dutch teach Americans World Cup last-16 lesson","The U.S. men's national team is out of the World Cup, undone by its own mistakes as the Netherlands showed a higher level in a 3-1 defeat."," The USMNT's 2022 World Cup run ended under the bright lights of Khalifa International Stadium on Saturday.  After spending the last two weeks showing how far it had come in developing an international identity, the team was shown by a true superpower what elite, ruthless soccer looks like.  It's clear that while the USMNT has grown, there is yet more growing up left to do before 2026. The tears flowed as the full-time whistle blew, with frustration at individual mistakes and missed opportunities in front of goal in the 3-1 defeat. A feeling that the Netherlands was better, but the USMNT also hurt itself. ""If you give them three, four chances, they're going to put them away,"" said a disappointed Tyler Adams to FOX afterwards. This was a lesson in what it takes to be among the best in the world. Top teams are clinical, cruel, vicious. And, throughout this tournament, the U.S. showed time and time again that it wasn't quite there. Finally, the players paid for it. The Netherlands, meanwhile, cemented its status as World Cup contenders. The Oranje warped the USMNT's defense, ruining a group stage's worth of hard work in 90 minutes. The U.S. made seismic error after seismic error, effectively engineering its own undoing as a quick two-goal deficit proved too much to overturn. It'll be a bitter pill to swallow. The USMNT has gotten better, that's for sure. The group stage was great evidence of that. But American soccer is still nowhere near the very best."

The Three Lions and Manchester City star joked that even he wasn't sure where he wanted to play, before deciding that just behind the striker would be his preference. Foden did highlight that he is more than capable of playing out wide, his current England position, but feels he would be better utilised through the middle. WHAT THEY SAID: ""I don't even know! Everywhere,"" Foden joked. ""I feel like I'm a 10, whether it's now or in the future, behind the striker, getting on the ball and trying to make things happen. I'm playing more out wide and I can do that job as well. At the same time I do like playing wide because you score more goals and get in the box a lot more."" THE BIGGER PICTURE: Having failed to start in England's first two group matches, Southgate chose to put Foden in his starting line-up against Wales amid clamour for his involvement, and the City starlet soon repaid his manager's faith. Foden got his first ever World Cup goal to score England's second in a 3-0 win, and his constant offensive threat has given the Three Lions boss a difficult decision ahead of their last-16 tie against Senegal on Sunday. IN THREE PHOTOS: DID YOU KNOW? Foden helped England finish top of their World Cup group for the first time since 2006, when they were eventually eliminated by Portugal at the quarter-final stage.

Leeds came within a whisker of signing Gakpo in the summer but saw a proposed move to Elland Road break down. Marsch admits it will now be difficult to land the Netherlands forward as his price tag has risen after some impressive performances for club and country. WHAT THEY SAID: ""It's difficult for us at Leeds because I think Gakpo's gotten out of our price range,"" he told Men in Blazers. ""I mean, we were so close to securing a transfer for him in the summer, it was so close, and now obviously it's disappointing. Our sport director was in Holland meeting with the family, they had agreed on terms, on everything, was talking with PSV. I mean, we were 99.9% [agreed].""

Hopefully tomorrow he will be able to come and be on the bench with the players but we are sure at 10pm he will be there with the team."" THE BIGGER PICTURE: Despite Bogaert's assurances, Cisse's absence from training as well as from his side's press conference just a day before their match against England will be of some concern to Senegal. Cisse helped mastermind a second-placed finish in Group A with a 2-1 win against Ecuador on matchday three, and will be sorely missed if he is unable to step out in the dugout on Sunday. STORY IN THREE PHOTOS: DID YOU KNOW? Against Ecuador, the Lions of Teranga became the first African nation to beat a South American side at the World Cup since Cameroon vs Colombia in 1990, ending a 21-game winless run (D4 L17).

Man City's Foden started, and scored in, England's 3-0 win over Wales that secured their place in the last 16 of the World Cup, which left many questioning why he wasn't afforded much game time in the other group games. He himself has now admitted he is ""disappointed"" not to start more at the World Cup, but is accepting due to the nature of the tournament. WHAT HE SAID: Speaking to the BBC, Foden said: ""It has been up and down. [I am] disappointed not to start more games but it is part of the tournament. I am a team player and when I get the opportunities I'll take them. ""I had seen a lot of media attention towards me to start, it is hard to get away from that, There is a lot [of competition]. [Bukayo] Saka has done well and scored in the first game, [Marcus] Rashford has scored and did very well against Wales. Everyone is scoring and everyone has proved a point so it will be a headache for Gareth [Southgate] to pick the team for the next game. I think I have every chance to start next match. I played well against Wales but we will have to see what happens."" THE BIGGER PICTURE: Foden's goal against Wales was his first in a major tournament for England and he told the BBC exactly how it felt. ""[Scoring against Wales was] definitely up there for one of the best feelings in my career so far, a special moment,"" he said. IN TWO PHOTOS:  WHAT NEXT FOR FODEN?

43,Blow for Brazil & Arsenal! Jesus ruled out of World Cup with injury - here's the games he could miss,Arsenal forward Gabriel Jesus has been ruled out of the rest of the World Cup with Brazil due to a knee injury.," WHAT HAPPENED? Jesus has been ruled out for up to a month with a persistent knee injury that he aggravated in Brazil's 1-0 group stage defeat to Cameroon on Friday, GOAL can confirm. He was substituted in the 64th minute and could be seen being consoled by Neymar at the end of the game. Brazil are awaiting further test results to determine the nature of the injury and the exact timeframe for his recovery. THE BIGGER PICTURE: The injury will not just rule Jesus out of the remainder of Brazil's World Cup campaign, but several games when the Arsenal return to domestic action. If Brazil were to reach the World Cup final, Jesus would miss up to eight games. Providing he doesn't have any setbacks, his return could come against Tottenham in the north London derby on January 15. AND WHAT'S MORE: Jesus has been in good form for Arsenal this season. He's scored five goals and assisted six in the Premier League and has played a part in all three of Brazil's World Cup games so far. Brazil are already sweating on Neymar's fitness ahead of facing South Korea in the last 16, with their talisman still recovering from an ankle injury sustained on matchday one.

In 2018, they made an early exit from the competition after crashing out from the group stages.  Can they do better this time around? They have qualified from Group H alongside Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal.

Paulo Bento will hope that his squad can cause a couple more upsets in the knockouts. "

Their miserable group-stage exit at the 2022 World Cup confirmed as much, as an ageing squad of star names struggled to stamp any kind of authority on the tournament before heading home after three games. Manager Roberto Martinez has already confirmed his departure, and this will surely be the last go around for a number of the team's stalwarts. Euro 2024 is only 18 months away, so some players might feel they have one more international tournament in them, but it feels highly unlikely that veterans like Toby Alderweireld, Axel Witsel and Jan Vertonghen will make it all the way to the 2026 World Cup. Injuries probably mean that Eden Hazard has also played his last World Cup, while Kevin De Bruyne and Romelu Lukaku will have to weigh up whether they can face another cycle while playing for what is likely to be a much-inferior team than they are used to. That is not to say Belgium do not have talented young players coming through, with some already part of the senior international squad. But who will be lining-up for them in the United States, Canada and Mexico in 2026, presuming they qualify? GOAL has had a go at predicting their next World Cup XI..."

Pochettino left his job as Paris Saint-Germain boss in the summer after just 17 months in charge of the Parisians. Despite winning the league, many considered last season a failure for the French giants as they fell at the round of 16 stage of the Champions League against Real Madrid. WHAT HE SAID: Pochettino hit out at critics who said his underwhelming performance in Europe was the reason for his dismissal, suggesting if that was the case, then perhaps other managers such as Guardiola should have received the same fate. He said: ""If [I left] PSG for not winning the Champions League, Guardiola should have already been sacked seven or eight times! These are different realities."" THE BIGGER PICTURE: Neither PSG nor Manchester City have ever won European football's biggest prize. Both sides have undergone major transitions in the past decade, with overseas investment turning them into powerhouses of world football, with just the Champions League missing from their respective trophy cabinets. IN TWO PHOTOS: WHAT NEXT FOR POCHETTINO? The ex-Spurs boss is currently unemployed, but is looking for a new job.

Switzerland did not have the ideal start in Qatar as they drew and lost against Cameroon and Brazil, respectively, in their first two matches.

Switzerland's 3-2 win over Serbia meant they finished second in Group G and set up a round of 16 clash against Portugal. Akanji and co. will face the legendary Ronaldo, who will almost certainly lead the line for his country, and the Swiss centre-back has revealed his plan to stop him. WHAT HE SAID: When asked about facing Ronaldo, Akanji said: ""Even though he's older now, he's an incredible goal machine. You can't give him any space in the penalty area. When he gets to the ball, the ball is usually inside. You have to be very close to him."" THE BIGGER PICTURE: Ronaldo has been in the headlines for the past few weeks following his explosive exit from Manchester United. He has scored one goal at the World Cup so far this year, but was somewhat off the pace against South Korea before being substituted as Portugal fell to a disappointing defeat.

There were quarter-final exits in 2006, 2010 and 2018, while they had to settle for fourth spot in 2014 after a tournament to forget. Now it's up to the likes of Neymar, Vinicius Junior and more to end the Selecao's drought and finally bring home the trophy once more. They went past Serbia and Switzerland but lost to Cameroon in their final group game. However, they have successfully booked their berth in the round of 16 as group winners.

Neymar was the victim of a particularly heavy challenge in Brazil's World Cup opener against Serbia, and hasn't featured at the tournament since. The talismanic attacker is still an injury doubt for their round of 16 clash against South Korea, with the game falling just three days after their final group stage match on Friday. WHAT THEY SAID: Brazil's team doctor, Rodrigo Lasmar, offered a tentative update for Neymar and teammate Alex Sandro, saying: ""We think we have time on our hands and there is a possibility. Let‚Äôs wait what their transition will be - they have still not started to practice with the ball and it‚Äôs something they will do tomorrow. It will be important to see how they respond to this new style, so depending on that, we will make a call.""

Coach Tite made nine changes for their final group game, which they lost 1-0 to Cameroon, with several first-team players missing out due to injury.

Maguire has had a far from ideal start to the season. He was dropped by Erik ten Hag after a string of poor performances and has seen his play time limited for Manchester United, but he has turned that form on its head for England. He has looked imperious at the back for the Three Lions and his defensive partner Stones has been full of praise for him ahead of England's round of 16 clash with Senegal. WHAT HE SAID: When asked about Maguire in a press conference, Stones said: ‚ÄúRight from the first game, the best response is what he‚Äôs been doing. All three games he‚Äôs played in have been terrific and it‚Äôs about us finding that partnership again. I think we have done (that) in these three games. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a great credit to him. Playing with someone for so many games at England, being through so many moments with him, knowing what he‚Äôs been going through at his club as well and the person that he is, I think it speaks volumes about him to come through that and still believe in himself. ""I believe in him, like (how) all the team believes in him. His teammates at United believe in him. He‚Äôs come into this tournament and hit the ground running, and that is a great credit to him.‚Äù THE BIGGER PICTURE: Maguire and Stones have played together 14 times at major tournaments since 2018, with England reaching the semi-final and final of the two competitions in that time period.

Les Bleus must bounce back from their surprise defeat to Tunisia to get the better of Czes≈Çaw Michniewicz's team, who made it to this round by getting four points from matches against Mexico and Saudi Arabia. France vs Poland latest odds France are unsurprisingly the favourites to get the win in this match in 90 minutes and progress to the next round at odds of 2/7 (1.29) with bet365. Poland are big outsiders to win at odds of 12/1 (13.00) while the draw is priced at 4/1 (5.00). France vs Poland first goal scorer odds Kylian Mbappe already has three goals to his name in the World Cup and is the obvious favourite to open the scoring at 3/1 (4.00) while compatriot Olivier Giroud is available at 4/1 (5.00). Robert Lewandowski is Poland's lowest-priced player to score the first goal of the game at 11/1 (12.00) while Arkadiusz Milik is 18/1 (19.00). France vs Poland preview France head into this game off the back of their shock defeat to Tunisia. But coach Didier Deschamps will not be too worried about that defeat given he made nine changes to the starting XI from the team that beat Denmark in their previous match. Kylian Mbappe, Antoine Griezmann and Olivier Giroud can expect to return to the team for the last 16 clash. Poland put in a reserved performance as they were beaten 2-0 by Argentina, failing to get a shot on target for the whole match. They will have to put in a much better display this time around as France will be quick to punish any wastefulness from Poland. France vs Poland tips and predictions France are expected to get the job done against Poland but there is little value in backing them. They look good value to win and keep a clean sheet, though, so backing France to win and against both teams scoring at odds of 5/6 (1.83) may be worth a bet instead.

Boulaye Dia is Senegal's lowest-priced player to break the deadlock in the African team's favour at 12/1 (13.00) while Famara Diedhiou and Ismaila Sarr are both set at 14/1 (15.00). England vs Senegal preview Senegal were rocked before the tournament as it was announced Sadio Mane would not play a part in the World Cup. But matters were made worse in their last group stage match as Idrissa Gueye picked up a suspension for the last 16 tie because he picked up two yellow cards.

61,How England should line up against Senegal: Drop Henderson but bring back Saka,Phil Foden and Marcus Rashford both impressed against Wales but will they retain their places in the line-up for Sunday's last-16 tie?," England boss Gareth Southgate has plenty of big decisions to make as he ponders his starting XI to face Senegal on Sunday evening. The Three Lions cruised into the knockout stages of the World Cup, with a 3-0 win against Wales sealing their passage through as group winners. Southgate rotated his side for that final group stage fixture and two of the players he brought in, Marcus Rashford and Phil Foden, stole the show, sharing all the goals between them. So what should the manager do against Senegal? We asked GOAL's Arsenal correspondent Charles Watts to pick the starting XI he would like to see at Al Bayt Stadium. This is what he went for, using the same 4-3-3 formation Southgate has utilised in all three of England's game so far..."
62,Enzo Fernandez: From Messi fan to Argentina's breakout star at Qatar 2022,The kid who wrote a letter to the No.10 six years ago urging him to keep playing for his country is now starring alongside his idol at the World Cup," Just like pretty much everyone else, Jose Peseiro was surprised to learn that Enzo Fernandez is only 21 years of age. ""Either that's a lie,"" Nigeria's Portuguese coach told A Bola, ""or he's a genius."" It's definitely not the former, but it could well be the latter.  The World Cup never fails to propel previously little-known players to superstardom, but the Fernandez fairy-tale is something truly special. We're talking about a kid that posted a heartfelt plea to Lionel Messi to reverse his decision to quit playing for Argentina after the 2016 Copa America. ""Do what you want, Lionel, but please think about staying. Stay and have fun,"" he wrote on Facebook. ""In a world of ridiculous pressures, they manage to get the most noble thing out of the game, the fun. ""Seeing you play with the light blue and white is the greatest pride in the world. Play for fun, because when you're having fun, you have no idea how much fun we have. Thank you and forgive us."" Last Saturday night, Fernandez took a pass from his idol just inside the Mexico penalty area and bent the ball into the top corner to seal a vital 2-0 victory. ""I know Enzo very well, here from the national team and I also played against him in the Champions League,"" Messi told reporters afterwards. ""He deserves it, because he‚Äôs a spectacular kid and a very important player for us."" There's no doubt about that now. Fernandez may have only made his international debut in September, but he is now a certain starter in Saturday's last-16 showdown with Australia.  The River Plate academy product was excellent in Wednesday's 2-0 win over Poland, creating the second goal for Julian Alvarez with a clever scooped pass between a couple of defenders.  Fernandez hasn't just impressed with his offensive threat, though, he's also been excellent from a defensive perspective, underlining precisely why he's long been regarded by those in the know as one of the most promising box-to-box midfielders in world football. Indeed, during a hugely beneficial loan spell at Defensa y Justicia in 2020-21, club president Diego Lemme told the youngster that he was a future Real Madrid player. And that prediction could well come true.  Madrid are just one of a plethora of elite European clubs vying for Fernandez's signature. He only joined Benfica from River during the summer, of course, but the Portuguese side stand to make a colossal profit on the ‚Ç¨10 million (¬£8m/$10m) they paid for the San Martin native, with Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Chelsea also reportedly interested. The battle for his services is wholly unsurprising. Fernandez's talent is as impressive as his temperament, as despite all of the hype, he's as grounded as they come.  He was first named on the River bench in January 2019, but didn't actually make it onto the pitch until March of the following year. Not long after, he was sent out on loan, but he wasn't upset; on the contrary, he embraced the move.  ""When Marcelo [Gallardo, River coach] told me about Defensa, I took it well because it was a chance to show myself, get some games and compete against first-rate players,"" Fernandez told Ole. ""I was lucky to be coached by two great trainers like Hernan Crespo and Sebastian Beccacece, share a squad with huge players and even better people, and pick up two titles (the Copa Sudamericana and the Recopa Sudamericana) which will go down in history. ""I have always been the same player, but my time at Defensa helped me grow so much, not just as a player but as a person. ""I grew up a lot and that prepared me to go back to River and adapt in a different way to the team's rhythm."" Meanwhile, when the Madrid rumours first surfaced after his return to the Monumental, Fernandez told TyC Sports that he would remain ""calm"" and ""humble"" and continue to keep a ""low profile"" off the pitch. He has a young daughter with his childhood sweetheart and is renowned for a level of maturity that belies his tender age. As reported by MARCA, he's also impressed everyone at Benfica with his work-rate and dedication to his craft. He brought his personal physio with him from Buenos Aires and immediately installed a gym in his Lisbon home. His hard work and professionalism paid off, with Lionel Scaloni handing Fernandez his first Argentina cap as a substitute in the 3-0 friendly win over Honduras just two months ago. It was just reward for a blistering start to the season in which he had scored both home and away against FC Midtjylland in the qualifying rounds of the Champions League. Fernandez would go on to feature in five of Benfica's six group games as the Eagles sensationally pipped Paris Saint-Germain to top spot in their group, knocking out Juventus in the process.  It's still staggering, though, that Fernandez has emerged as such a pivotal player for Argentina at the World Cup. Wednesday's start against Poland was his first for his country but it was wholly justified. Argentina's Copa America triumph last year owed much to the influence of Giovani Lo Celso, who was ruled out of the World Cup through injury. And with Leandro Paredes and Rodrigo De Paul both struggling for form and fitness, Scaloni needed someone to step up, and that's exactly what Fernandez has done. He is proving an excellent link between Argentina's midfield and attack.  Messi is having fun again for a variety of reasons. But the kid who so touchingly urged him to continue playing six years ago is undoubtedly one of them. Which was the best World Cup winning team? Which was the best World Cup winning team?"
63,PSG president Al-Khelaifi insists French giants don't have big January transfer window plans,Paris Saint-Germain president Nasser Al-Khelaifi has suggested the club will not make any signings in January.," WHAT HAPPENED? PSG are top of the French league after dropping just four points all season. The Parisians have one of the most star-studded line-ups in world football and are constantly adding to the squad to ensure they stay at that level. However, it doesn't look like they will be making any additions in January with president Al-Khelaifi seemingly rules out any signings. WHAT HE SAID: Speaking to L'Equipe about whether PSG are planning on making any additions in the new year, Al-Khelafi said: ""We'll see, but I don't think so. We don't ned anyone. We have to keep the same team. I think we have found a collective spirit and that we are well."" THE BIGGER PICTURE: After something of a spending spree in the summer, it's hard to see where Christophe Galtier's side may need any additions in the second half of the season. Improving on a front three of Lionel Messi, Neymar and Kylian Mbappe seems pretty impossible, while their defence and midfield is blessed with depth and quality not many other teams possess. PSG have previously been linked with now-free agent Cristiano Ronaldo, but a move now seems unlikely. IN THREE PHOTOS: WHAT NEXT FOR PSG? PSG are back in action on the December 28 when they face Strasbourg in Ligue 1. The fixture falls just 10 days after the World Cup final, in which many of their squad will hope to feature.  "

WHAT THEY SAID: Speaking to reporters, Ronaldo said: ""The Korean player was telling me to leave quickly and I told him to shut up because he has no authority. There is no need for controversy.

68,'We got along great!' - The story of Diego Forlan and the Jabulani match ball at South Africa 2010,"The Uruguay legend wrote his name into World Cup history by mastering the quirks of an adidas ball that Luis Fabiano had labelled ""very weird""."," The first World Cup to ever take place in Africa was marked with adidas‚Äô release of the Jabulani match ball, which included eight spherically moulded panels designed to drastically improve aerodynamics. The Zulu word for Jabulani means ‚Äúrejoice‚Äù, but it's fair to say it wasn't warmly received. Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon described the ball as ‚Äúabsolutely inadequate‚Äù, while Brazil striker Luis Fabiano labelled it ""very weird"". ""All of a sudden, it changes trajectory on you,"" the latter explained. ""I think it‚Äôs supernatural, it‚Äôs very bad.‚Äù¬† However, one man embraced the Jabulani's physics-defying potential right from the off. ‚ÄúThree months before the 2010 World Cup, Diego Forlan asked adidas to send him a Jabulani ball,"" the striker's former Uruguay team-mate Sebastian Abreu told El Observador in 2020. ""At Atletico Madrid, he stayed after the training, practising moves with the ball in motion and free-kicks.‚Äù That extra practice paid off in Uruguay‚Äôs second group game, against tournament hosts South Africa, with Forlan scoring twice in a 3-0 win. His first goal silenced the vuvuzelas inside a rocking Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium, as he picked the ball up some 30 yards from goal before letting fly. The ball swooped and swerved in multiple directions on its way to the back of the net and left the South African keeper rooted to the spot.  It would prove a sign of things to come. Uruguay's quarter-final clash with Ghana is obviously best remembered for Luis Suarez's infamous handball, which denied The Black Stars what would have been an extra-time winner. However, it was also a game in which Forlan's due diligence would be once again rewarded in spectacular fashion. With the Celeste 1-0 down 10 minutes into the second half, the former Manchester United forward stepped up to take a free-kick on the far left of the box. Forlan lashed the ball home with unerring confidence to change the momentum of a game that ended in a shootout victory for Uruguay. That controversial victory earned the Celeste a heavyweight semi-final tie against a free-scoring Netherlands outfit led by Robin van Persie. Giovanni van Bronckhorst produced a stunning, Forlan-esque strike from distance to put the Dutch in front. However, the man himself refused to be overshadowed and underlined his status as the most consistent ball-striker at the tournament with another sensational effort to draw Uruguay level just before the break, finding the top corner with his weaker left foot. Oscar Tabarez‚Äôs side ended up losing 3-2, though, and were beaten by the same scoreline in their third-place play-off with Germany. However, Forlan continued to showcase his mastery of the match ball, scoring another screamer to seal the Golden Boot, after cleverly volleying the ball into the ground and past Germany No.1 Oliver Kahn. The striker‚Äôs fifth goal at the finals ended up being voted the best of the tournament, controversially pipping Van Bronckhorst‚Äôs semi-final piledriver to the title, and capped one of the most remarkable individual World Cup showings of all time. Forlan was also presented with the Golden Ball as the tournament‚Äôs best player, ahead of Wesley Sneijder and David Villa, as a just reward for the way he was able to tame the Jabulani like no other. Conspiracy theories abounded. Some claimed that Forlan had inside information on how to get the most out of the Jabulani, while others suggested the ball was actually under remote control. The Uruguay legend set the record straight during an interview with Between the Lines in April, backing up Abreu's story. ""There are no mysteries here. A lot of practice, a lot of training and again a lot of practice,"" he said. ""I got lucky and [the Jabulani] behaved very well back then. And we got along great!"" Who will progress to the FIFA World Cup quarter-finals? Who will progress to the FIFA World Cup quarter-finals?"

Germany thought they were done with embarrassment on the global stage after their groups-stage exit in 2018, but the football gods had other plans for Hansi Flick's team in Qatar. Germany's loss to Japan in their opening game ultimately cost them this time around, and the 2014 winners have now backed that up by falling at the first hurdle in each of the next two tournaments. Factor in their last-16 exit at Euro 2020, and it has not been a stellar run for German football, meaning there is immense pressure on Flick to restore one of the sport's most decorated international teams to their former glories, and quickly. Germany, of course, are the hosts of the next European Championship in 2024, and so the clock is already ticking on making sure they are able to challenge for more silverware on home soil.

THE BIGGER PICTURE: As he often is, Suarez has been the centre of attention this week for his comments regarding Asamoah Gyan's missed penalty in the 2010 World Cup quarter-finals. Suarez controversially 'saved' a goal-bound shot, resulting in a penalty and a red card for himself, however Gyan missed the spot-kick and Uruguay eventually defeated Ghana on penalties. Suarez claimed this week that it was not his fault that Ghana were eliminated, as he did not miss the penalty. IN TWO PHOTOS:  It was a real rollercoaster of emotions for Suarez on Friday afternoon... WHAT NEXT FOR SUAREZ?

Lionel Scaloni has got the team working as a unit and Lionel Messi is in good form in the attacking third. After a shock defeat to Saudi Arabia in their opener, they have bounced back strongly with wins against Mexico and Poland to finish top of Group C and progress to the round of 16.  The Albiceleste will face Australia in the next round and if they play to their potential they should get to the quarter-finals.

They then failed to make it to the World Cup again until 2018, but are now making their third appearance at the showpiece event after ousting Mohamed Salah's Egypt in the qualifiers. They picked up two consecutive victories against Qatar and Ecuador respectively in the group stage to qualify for the round of 16. Now they are set to face England on Sunday in the battle for a quarter-final berth.  Not a straightforward encounter by any means, but head coach Aliou Cisse will hope that the AFCON champions will ride on experience and squad depth to negotiate it successfully. "
84,USMNT World Cup 2022 roster: Predicted lineup vs Netherlands and star players,GOAL breaks down the USMNT squad ahead of the knockout rounds," The USMNT is at the World Cup for the 11th time in their history, back after they failed to qualify for the 2018 edition in Russia altogether. Gregg Berhalter and his men will be desperate to make amends for that performance by going far in Qatar and they sure have the talent to spring a surprise. They've already cleared the first hurdle, escaping from a group that included England, Wales and Iran. And they escaped without a loss, making them one of only five teams at this World Cup to avoid tasting defeat so far. Their reward? A match against one of the other five: the Netherlands. It will be a tough test for a young U.S. group that will still have reason to believe after, at times, dominating in the group stage.

85,Which teams have qualified for World Cup 2022 knockout stage?,Let's take a look at the teams that have already booked their ticket for the round of 16 now that we're nearing the end of the group stages," There is no denying that it has been an exciting start to the 2022 World Cup, with plenty of surprises and spectacular encounters on show in the first two matchdays of the group stages. There was Saudi Arabia's shock win over Argentina, Germany throwing away a one-goal lead versus Japan and Belgium losing to Morocco to name just a few upsets. And there has been no shortage of goals either, with Spain smashing seven past Costa Rica, Cameroon and Serbia playing out a hugely entertaining 3-3 draw and England hammering Iran 6-2. But the question on everyone's mind as we enter matchday three is what all that means for the knockout stages and which teams have already secured progress to the round of 16. Qualified for World Cup round of 16 Netherlands topped Group A, with Senegal coming second ahead of Qatar and Wales. England and the USMNT advance from Group B, while Lionel Messi inspired Argentina to the top of Group C after their opening-game upset against Saudi Arabia. Poland join the Albiceleste as Group C runners-up. France and Australia qualified from Group D, while Morocco sprung an upset on Belgium in Group E and topped the table, with Croatia advancing as the runners-up. Japan were shock winners of Group F, topping the table ahead of Spain and Germany, with Hansi Flick's side bowing out.

86,'Free as a bird' - Piers Morgan reveals what Cristiano Ronaldo text him following Man Utd exit,"Piers Morgan has revealed that Cristiano Ronaldo sent him a text message saying he feels ""free as a bird"" following his exit from Manchester United."," WHAT HAPPENED? Morgan exchanged a number of messages with the Portugal star, with both joking about his feeling of freedom after leaving the Manchester club. The TV host, whose interview helped Ronaldo get ejected from United, also thought rumours of a Saudi transfer were premature. WHAT THEY SAID: ""I texted Cristiano a GIF of William Wallace in¬†Braveheart¬†shouting: 'Freedom!',"" Morgan revealed. ‚ÄúHe thought that was a perfect summation of how he felt. ‚ÄòFree as a bird‚Äô was his response."" On reports of a blockbuster move to Saudi Arabian club Al-Nassr, Morgan responded: ""He thinks that if he does well at this World Cup, he‚Äôll get what he really wants, which is a club in the Champions League that extends his record and his legacy. It‚Äôs not about money at this stage of his career. It comes down to a burning desire to play football at the highest level, to break records and win trophies. And he has done that in more countries than any other player in history."" THE BIGGER PICTURE: While Ronaldo may be eyeing a move to one of Europe's top teams, his performances at the World Cup aren't helping his chances. A record-breaking opening day penalty caught the headlines, but since then the 37-year-old has underwhelmed, and was personally responsible for South Korea's equaliser against Portugal as they recorded a famous comeback victory on Friday. IN TWO PHOTOS: DID YOU KNOW? Ronaldo has attempted exactly 100 shots at World Cup tournaments, the first player to reach this total since full shot data is available (1966). WHAT NEXT FOR RONALDO?

87,"Martinelli shines but where was Jesus? Brazil winners, losers and ratings as Aboubakar and Cameroon provide latest World Cup upset","The tournament of shocks delivered again as Cameroon left it late to secure a famous win over the World Cup favourites, who are still without Neymar."," Not even Brazil are safe in this tournament of upsets. After Argentina, Germany, Belgium, France and Spain came this latest shock. It didn't cost the Selecao too much, but this 1-0 defeat to Cameroon provided another memorable World Cup moment, and raises questions as to whether Tite's side really should be considered favourites. Vincent Aboubakar's 92nd-minute header secured victory for Cameroon, though it was not enough to secure them qualification to the last 16 due to Switzerland's win over Serbia. Still, this was a famous win for the Indomitable Lions, one to go alongside their famous humbling of Argentina in 1990. Brazil, in fairness, were already sure of qualification - they will face South Korea in the last 16 - and so made nine changes to their starting line-up. But they lost another player, Alex Telles, to injury and coach Tite is still waiting for his vaunted array of attackers to fire.  Gabriel Martinelli, the Arsenal forward, was the best on show here, but Brazil wasted a host of chances before being caught by Aboubakar's late sucker punch.

88,Switzerland have their own GOAT! Shaqiri rolls back the years to book last-16 ticket after World Cup epic against Serbia,Xherdan Shaqiri played a pivotal role as Switzerland qualified for the last 16 of the World Cup following a memorable encounter against Serbia.," TELL ME MORE: Xherdan Shaqiri became only the third player to score at the last three World Cups with his deflected opener getting the ball rolling, although his strike was soon cancelled out by a textbook Aleksandr Mitrovic header. It was Shaqiri's giveaway that led to Serbia's second thanks to an expert Dusan Vlahovic finish, but Breel Embolo was on hand to draw his side level in a blockbuster first 45 minutes. Remo Freuler finished off a fine team move to give the Swiss the advantage shortly after the break, as Murat Yakin's side held out for all three points. THE MVP: Xherdan Shaqiri. Being among the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi is some pretty impressive company. Shaqiri's fifth ever World Cup goal saw him score in his third successive tournament thanks to a close-range strike which got Switzerland off to a winning start. He also played a part in his side's decisive third goal and was a constant menace to Serbia's defence before being substituted on 69 minutes. THE BIG LOSER: Whoever chose to watch the Brazil game! While Tite's men may have slipped to a shock defeat to Cameroon in Group G's other match, it was an uneventful affair compared to this one. Serbia and Switzerland treated viewers to five goals, four of which came in the first half alone. While the second half may have petered out slightly, it was still a contender for game of the tournament. Big L for those who chose not to tune in.

Stones has joined the likes of Gary Neville in heaping praise on the 22-year-old who hasn't played his way into Gareth Southgate's plans just yet, despite many a player and pundit saying Foden should be starting.  WHAT THEY SAID: Speaking in a press conference, Stones said: ""I've never seen anyone like Phil, at that age, with his ability and his football knowledge. It is the freedom in how he plays and how he expresses himself. It is frightening. I am a huge fan of him. I am lucky to play with him every day. I am lucky, Man City are lucky and England are lucky."" THE BIGGER PICTURE: Foden hasn't really been able to lay his mark down thus far, only starting one of England's three group games with the likes of Mason Mount and Marcus Rashford preferred. The same can't be said for Stones who has partnered Harry Maguire in every England game thus far. That looks set to continue with Southgate seemingly decided on his centre-back pairing.  IN THREE PHOTOS:      WHAT NEXT FOR FODEN?

However, until recently, it seemed unlikely the youngster would go down in history for his exploits at this World Cup. He only started one of England's three group games and sat out the 0-0 draw against the USMNT completely. But after scoring against Wales he may have forced his way into the team for the knockout stages.  WHAT NEXT FOR FODEN? While it's almost certain he's seen this tweet because of the traction it has generated, Foden's attention will solely be on England's round of 16 tie against Senegal on Sunday.

Spain's World Cup group stage finish Spain started their World Cup campaign with a historic 7-0 win over Costa Rica. However, they could not keep up their brilliant start as they were held by Germany to a 1-1 draw and then suffered to a 2-1 defeat to Japan on matchday three.  Spain's last-16 opponents Spain have finished runners-up in Group E which means they will face the toppers from Group F.

Spain failed to win Group E thanks to a three-minute second-half turnaround that was completed by a controversial Ao Tanaka goal. The result meant Spain scraped through to the knockout stages ahead of Germany on virtue of goal difference. The performance was a far cry from the one Spain produced in the 7-0 win over Costa Rica, and the coach admitted that his team's collapse left him ""annoyed"".

103,Bring on Gakpo! How the USMNT defense became one of the World Cup's meanest,The Netherlands attacker is the breakout star of the World Cup but Gregg Berhalter's brilliant backline is capable of shutting him down on Saturday.," We've all heard the famous saying about an irresistible force meeting an immovable object. And we're all going to see it play out on Saturday at Khalifa International Stadium. That irresistible force is one Cody Gakpo, the world's most in-form attacker. The Dutch starlet has taken his game into a new stratosphere, dominating the Eredivisie before making the World Cup his playground with three goals in as many games. He has 21 goal contributions in 14 Eredivisie games this season and he's scored with his left, right and his head since arriving in Qatar.  Gakpo, statistically, is the best attacker in the world right now. As for the immovable object, meet the U.S. men's national team's defense. Three games, one goal, none from open play. They've stifled the likes of Harry Kane and, at least mostly, Gareth Bale. Pretty good competition by any stretch. They've survived periods in which they've dominated and periods in which they've been dominated. Three different centerbacks have started, and each has had a part to play in leading the USMNT to the knockout stages.  The USMNT, statistically, is right there among the best defensive teams in this World Cup. Entering Friday's games, every other team that has finished the group stage has conceded at least once from open play. So, now what? Cody Gakpo is the breakout star of this World Cup üìà pic.twitter.com/ryKcIPgZ7c It's hard to reduce a game like Saturday's round-of-16 clash between the USMNT and the Netherlands to one matchup, simply because there are too many storylines to keep track of.  There's Sergino Dest's clash with his home country and Gregg Berhalter's extended stay in Holland as a player. There's the injury to Christian Pulisic, the illness of Frenkie de Jong. Memphis Depay is in the news for trying to choose his own partner up top, while the USMNT's striker situation remains very much in flux. It'll take a combination of things for either side to win this game and book their quarterfinal spot but, in many ways, looking at Gakpo's battle with the USMNT defense is a good place to start. The dynamic 23-year-old is arguably the star of this World Cup, at least so far. He was already making waves with his play for PSV, but the hype has reached overdrive in Qatar. At some point soon, some Premier League club will pay a bazillion dollars for him. That's what happens when you perform in the way he has. Gakpo is actually that damn good.  He hasn't had as many chances as some other forwards, but he surely hasn't wasted the ones he's gotten. Gakpo is one of those players that needs just one opportunity to change a game and, ultimately, a World Cup. So, how does the USMNT counteract that? Well, Berhalter has been doing his homework. ""We've been watching Holland for the last 11 months, watching all their games,"" he said. ""We've had multiple people at their group stage games watching live with the wide angle, so we're gonna do a deep dive on them.  ""All the information was presented to us immediately after the game against Iran and we were able to start preparing."" ""We're looking at how they play, at what they do, how they create chances, how they press,"" Berhalter continued. ""Every face of the play, we're analyzing. We're looking at set pieces, the whole thing."" Credit to Berhalter and his scouting team for how the U.S. has been able to neutralize opponents so far. But credit to the players themselves, too, all of whom have stepped up to a level few saw coming. The centerbacks deserve plenty of credit, especially Tim Ream. How good has he been? For a player that, just a few months ago, was nowhere near the national team picture, Ream has been better than anyone could have ever imagined.  During this World Cup, he's been partnered by two different teammates. Walker Zimmerman started against Wales and England before coming on late against Iran to swat away cross after cross.  Cameron Carter-Vickers, meanwhile, stepped in against Iran, with Berhalter pointing to his ability to play against a team in a low block thanks to his time at Celtic. It hasn't just been the centerbacks, though. Dest has been marvelous at fullback, looking like a completely different player than the one that was, to put it lightly, disinterested when it came to defending for several years.  Antonee Robinson has been his steady self but Tyler Adams has gone supersonic, emerging as an elite defensive midfielder at the most elite level. When you add in the pressing work done by Haji Wright and Josh Sargent up top, you get a clear vision of how the U.S. defend: with everyone doing their part. That is how you generally stop a player like Gakpo. You don't stop him when he gets the ball; you stop him before he gets it. And the USMNT defense has put that line of thinking on full display twice this tournament. Against Wales, the U.S. put Bale in an on-pitch prison cell. He was constantly surrounded by Zimmerman, Ream and the three midfielders. Whenever the ball would go anywhere near him, the door would slam shut, taking away Bale as an option. Then, against England, the U.S. earmarked the centerbacks as the initiators of the Three Lions attack, so they hounded them, not allowing John Stones or Harry Maguire to play with the ball.  It led to a disjointed attacking performance from England as the job was made easier for those deeper in defense thanks to the work of those up front. The USMNT will need to apply those principles against the Netherlands. They'll need to put Virgil van Dijk under pressure. They'll need to surround midfield playmaker De Jong.  And, most importantly, they'll have to make sure that Gakpo never, ever gets the ball in a place where he can make something happen. ""They have some real talent with Memphis Depay and Gakpo and [Steven] Bergwijn, just really top-end talent,"" Berthalter said, ""but for us, it's about the collective.  ""The backline has done a great job. The goalkeeper has done a great job, but it's about team defending, working as a unit, moving collectively. ""And when we do that, we put the opponent in difficult positions where they can't access the spaces they want to access. I think that's been what we've been good at so far."" It's never that easy though, is it? The whole world knows about Gakpo, and Netherlands manager Louis van Gaal knows that the whole world knows about Gakpo. The Dutch boss isn't going to sit back and let things play out; he's going to put his players in a position to shine. He's no doubt been watching hours of film on the U.S. after admitting that, prior to arriving in Qatar, he'd never seen Berhalter's side play.  ""If you watch them play, it's crystal clear they've had opportunities,"" Van Gaal said. ""I don't think it's a surprise to be quite honest.  ""The USA has an excellent 'team'. I would say one of the best 'teams', fine-tuned. It's going to be a very tough match. But it's nothing we can't overcome. We also have a good team, that's my view.  ""We'll have to wait and see in this match which of the two squads is the best. I'm not going to downplay the USA. On the contrary, they're an example of what a good team is supposed to be."" As Van Gaal says, this will be a battle of two talented teams. On paper, the Netherlands may have slightly more quality, but you can't write off a U.S. team that has already gone toe-to-toe with England.  And, in a World Cup, you can never write off a team that has had a defense like the USMNT's. It's hard to lose if you don't concede, right? Saturday's game will likely be a tight, tense affair defined by battles all over the field. The most important of those battles will be between Gakpo and a USMNT defense that will be designed to keep him quiet. They've kept superstars quiet before, though. Who wins, then? Does the force of Gakpo finally meet resistance? Can the Dutch starlet move the immovable?  We're about to find out... Which was the best World Cup winning team?

104,'FIFA are always against us!' - Luis Suarez fumes after Uruguay denied penalty against Ghana and crash out of World Cup,"Luis Suarez sensationally claimed that FIFA ""is always against Uruguay"" after they crashed out of the World Cup despite victory over Ghana on Friday."," WHAT HAPPENED? Suarez's criticisms extended towards the penalty given against Uruguay's Josema Gimenez and the one not awarded for a supposed foul on forward Darwin Nunez. The veteran striker then took shots at football's governing body, claiming FIFA take advantage over Uruguay due to its lack of ""power"". WHAT THEY SAID: ""The Josema (Gimenez) penalty was detrimental to us because of the goals conceded and so was the one given to Darwin,"" Suarez protested. ""The people at FIFA and the Referees Committee have to give explanations as to what they are basing their decision to award the incredible penalties that are being awarded and we didn't get two today. ""It's not an excuse, but we also have to respond to that lack of power. After the game I wanted to see my children and the FIFA people told me no, when a France player was with his children on the bench. It seems that Uruguay has to have more power, FIFA is always against Uruguay."" THE BIGGER PICTURE: Suarez's complaints echo the unsavoury scenes at the final whistle which saw Uruguay players and coaching staff surround the referee in protest. Despite the Celeste beating Ghana 2-0 on the night, a late Hwang Hee-chan winner against Portugal sent South Korea through to the last 16 on goals scored, leaving Suarez and Co. visibly distraught both on and off the pitch. IN THREE PHOTOS: DID YOU KNOW? Suarez was the only player in the starting line-ups for Ghana-Uruguay who also started the 2010 World Cup quarter-final between the two teams. He was shown a red card for a deliberate handball in that match. WHAT NEXT FOR SUAREZ? At 35-years-old, Qatar 2022 will likely be Suarez's last World Cup of his career, ending in bitter disappointment epitomised by the forward's tears at the final whistle.

Ronaldo and Lee Sung-Jae had a couple of words as the Portuguese talisman made way for Andre Silva 65 minutes into South Korea's 2-1 win, a victory that saw them through to the knockout stages in second place behind Portugal. Ronaldo's reaction left viewers confused as to why he seemed unhappy about coming off knowing his side's place in the knockouts was secured. However, it was something Lee said that caused the reaction.  WHAT THEY SAID: Speaking soon after the defeat, Santos said: ""Cristiano Ronaldo left upset because a Korean player was sending him away and Pepe even had to intervene. I heard what the Korean player was saying. If you see the images, you see Pepe going after the South Korean because of that."" Ronaldo also gave his view on the situation, saying: ""What happened was that, before my departure, the player from Korea told me to leave quickly. I told him to shut up. He has no authority, he doesn't have to give an opinion, he would speed up the pace if he were the referee. But there doesn‚Äôt have to be controversy, things stay on the pitch."" THE BIGGER PICTURE: Ronaldo has played second fiddle to Bruno Fernandes during the tournament with the Manchester United man impressing and Ronaldo not perhaps performing to the levels he'd expect from himself. He only has one goal to his name thus far - a penalty against Ghana.  IN THREE PHOTOS:   WHAT NEXT FOR RONALDO?

The official USMNT Twitter account then confirmed: ""UPDATE: Christian Pulisic has been cleared to play in tomorrow‚Äôs match versus Netherlands."" THE BIGGER PICTURE: Pulisic had already vowed to do 'everything in his power' to ensure that he is ready to face the Dutch on Saturday. Indeed, it now appears certain the Chelsea forward will be in the starting XI at the Khalifa International Stadium, boosting his side's chances of causing an upset and advancing to the quarter-finals.

Serbia have just one point from two games, and will require a win to have a chance at qualifying for the Round of 16.

Other cameras may offer misleading images but on the evidence available, the whole of the ball was not out of play. pic.twitter.com/HKKEot0j1Y STORY IN TWO PHOTOS:  Which was the best World Cup winning team?

121,How extra time & penalties work in the World Cup knockout stage,Everything you need to know about extra time and penalty shootouts in the 2022 World Cup.," After the World Cup group stages comes to a close, the top two nations from each group enter a 16-team knockout. The winner of each match will progress from the round of 16 to the quarter-final, semi-final and eventually, the final. But what if both sides are level after 90 minutes? To help you get up to speed, GOAL brings you everything you need to know about how extra time and penalties work in the World Cup. When does a game go to extra time? Games go to extra time in the knockout stages of a tournament when both teams are level after regulation time.  Some knockout tournaments, such as the English FA Cup, have a 'replay' following a draw, which involves the same fixture played with the home and away sides reversed.  Given that a World Cup is played at a neutral venue (apart from for the host nation), this method isn't feasible, meaning extra time is the adopted format in the knockout stages. How long is extra time in football? Extra time consists of two halves of 15 minutes amounting to 30 extra minutes in total. Extra time is not to be confused with 'added time', which describes the minutes added on to each half due to stoppages in play (e.g. an injury, substitution, goal celebrations, etc.).  Extra time can have its own 'added time' at the end of each half, although this is usually no more than a few minutes due to the shortness of the periods. When does a game go to penalties? If both teams are level after 120 minutes of football, including any necessary 'added time', the game will go to a penalty shootout.  While this is not always the case in tournaments that employ the 'away goals' rule, this again is not used at the World Cup given that it is held at a neutral venue.  This means all tied games after 120 minutes will go to a penalty shootout, more commonly referred to as simply 'penalties'. How many penalties are taken in a shootout? Each team takes five penalties each. The spot kicks can be taken by any player who finished the game on the pitch, including the goalkeeper, but cannot be taken by any of the substitutes. The team to score the most of their five penalties wins the game and goes through to the next round. What order are penalties hit in? Penalties are taken in alternating order - so team A, team B, team A, team B, and so on. The team to take the first spot kick is decided by a coin toss before the shootout, and the referee chooses which goal the penalties will be taken in. What is sudden-death in penalty shootouts? Sudden-death is used when both teams are still level after their respective five spot kicks. If the scores are equal after five kicks, each team will have one penalty each to try and score until the other fails.  So, if team A scores their kick, team B must score theirs to stay in the game. If team A misses, team B must score to win. If both miss or both score, the sudden-death continues until one team has the advantage and therefore eventually progresses to the next round.

The Netherlands have joined the likes of Spain and Brazil in having flu-like symptoms in their squad during the World Cup. This could be a direct result of the massive air conditioning units that have been installed to keep the temperature at pitch-level bearable for the players.  WHAT THEY SAID: Speaking in the pre-match press conference ahead of the game against USMNT, Van Gaal said: ""We are not going to elaborate on that but if it goes around in the group, it is worrying. There are not fifteen or so [affected]. In principle, everyone is fit and available.""

USMNT coach Gregg Berhalter has suggested he is unsure how best to use Gio Reyna at the World Cup having only brought him on once but insists the talented playmaker can have an impact for his team in the knockout stages of the tournament. WHAT THEY SAID: Speaking to reporters on Friday, Berhalter said of Reyna's lack of minutes: ""I think a lot of it comes down to timing and circumstance. If you look at how the games have unfolded, we've had the lead and had to hold on to the lead later in games. The only game that we didn't have that scenario, we actually put him in to help get the victory. So it's just how we can use him in the most effective way. He's a really talented player and we're looking for the right moment but he can no doubt help this team."" THE BIGGER PICTURE: Berhalter is right in his assertion that his side have led games in the group stage and so a more defensive approach was needed. Acknowledging Reyna's talent, the 20-year-old can be a key creator from the bench when it's win or bust in the knockouts.  IN A PHOTO:  WHAT NEXT?

Fred is still proving to be full of running, as is often the case at club level, with Tite‚Äôs backroom team having to keep a close eye on him as he has been losing around three kilos per outing in the Middle East. WHAT THEY SAID: Brazil fitness instructor Fabio Fabio Mahseradjian has said: ‚ÄúFred is a very mobile and typically endurance athlete. He‚Äôs not as fast as [Gabriel] Martinelli or Rodrygo. He‚Äôs not a strength athlete like Richarlison. They are individual characteristics of others, but he has his own, which is very mobile and of high resistance. We pay a lot of attention to Fred regarding his recovery. Because he loses a lot of weight during the game precisely because of this great work rate.

Can they finally realise their dream of world domination?," Argentina have won the World Cup twice in their history (1978 & 1986) and the Albiceleste will fancy their chances of going all the way in Qatar 2022 after a hiatus of 36 years. They beat arch-rivals Brazil in the 2021 Copa America final to lift the trophy at the Maracana Stadium and will be hoping to repeat their heroics on the world stage at Lusail Stadium on December 18. So, what will Argentina and Lionel Messi need to do to ensure the country becomes world champions for the first time since 1986? GOAL takes a look at their potential route to the final. Argentina's World Cup group stage finish Argentina finished top of the group with six points, with Poland coming in two points behind them in second place.  Lionel Scaloni's men started their campaign on a disappointing note as they lost 2-1 to Saudi Arabia, but came strongly with two consecutive 2-0 victories against Mexico and Poland.  Argentina's last-16 opponents Argentina have finished top of Group C which means they will face the runners-up from Group D. Australia finished behind France in that pool, so Argentina will go up against the Socceroos in the round of 16.  The game will go ahead on December 3, 2022 at the Ahmad bin Ali Stadium. The game is set to kick off at 7pm GMT (2pm ET). Argentina's possible quarter-final opponents If Argentina beat Australia, they will face the winner between the Netherlands and the USA.  That quarter-final will take place at 7pm GMT (2pm ET) on December 9, at the Lusail Stadium. Argentina's possible semi-final opponents If Argentina make it through to the semi-finals, they will face either the winners of Japan and Croatia, Groups G or the runners-up of Group H.  That would put them up against Portugal, Ghana, South Korea or Uruguay from Group H, or Brazil, Switzerland, Cameroon or Serbia from Group G. The semi-final will take place on December 13 at 7pm GMT (2pm ET) at Lusail Stadium. Argentina's possible World Cup final opponents As group winners, Argentina will meet a team from the other side of the bracket should they progress to the final. England, Spain, France are all potential opponents. There are also the winners of Groups H and or the runners-up of Group G.

129,Why is South Korea's Heung-min Son wearing a mask at the World Cup?,The Spurs attacker is sporting a face mask at the World Cup - here's why," If South Korea are to have an impact at World Cup 2022 in Qatar, they need Heung-min Son to be on top of his game. The Tottenham star has been dazzling in the Premier League over the past number of seasons and he comes onto football's biggest stage for the third - and potentially final - time with his country. However, the 30-year-old goal-getter is sporting an unusual look when he lines up against Uruguay, Ghana and Portugal in Group H. His face is partially covered by a mask when he plays, but it's not a fashion statement. So what's it all about then? GOAL brings you everything you need to know. Why is Heung-min Son wearing a mask at the World Cup? Heung-min Son is wearing a face mask at the World Cup as a protective measure after suffering a facial injury while playing for his club. The mask is designed to shield the facial bones from impact and thus it minimises the risk of further injury, which could affect his chances of playing. Son sustained the injury while playing for Tottenham in a Champions League clash against Marseille at the beginning of November, suffering a fractured eye socket when he collided with Chancel Mbemba. The eye injury required surgery to ensure a full recovery and concerns mounted that it would rule him out of the South Korea World Cup squad. ""We can confirm that Heung-Min Son will undergo surgery to stabilise a fracture around his left eye,"" a statement from Tottenham explained. ""Following surgery, Son will commence rehabilitation with our medical staff and we shall update supporters further in due course."" However, the prognosis was positive for the Tigers of Asia and he was passed fit to play. In an Instagram post, Son said: ""Playing for your country at the World Cup is the dream of so many children growing up, just as it was one of mine too. ""I won‚Äôt miss this for the world. I can‚Äôt wait to represent our beautiful country, see you soon. Sonny."" While face masks are not a common sight in football, a number of high profile players have worn them while playing. Antonio Rudiger, for example, wore one while playing for Germany at Euro 2020, while Chelsea star Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang had to don one back in September. Interestingly, while Aubameyang needed to wear the mask while playing due to injury, he has also produced superhero masks as part of celebrations. Others have mimicked this approach, with Mexico striker Raul Jimenez doing likewise in games for Benfica and Wolves. Where to buy protective face masks Protective face masks are medical equipment and can be sourced through a hospital, doctor or pharmacist. As well as eye injuries, they are designed to protect a broad range of facial bones, such as the nose, cheek and orbital. They can cost from $60/¬£60 upwards and you should consult with a doctor if you believe you should wear one. Who will progress to the FIFA World Cup quarter-finals?

WHAT THEY SAID: Chelsea captain Azpilicueta, who was replaced at half-time by Dani Carvajal, has addressed claims that La Roja threw in the towel against Japan, telling reporters: ‚ÄúI was aware in the second half [of the Germany score]; I was on the bench so I was aware of the situation. If they look at our group the last couple of years we always give everything and we go out of the pitch to win every game, to press every ball. We have been punished from just scoring a goal and then conceding straight away so that‚Äôs the way we play. We are the first disappointed to not win the game so you can see what happened. It was difficult because it is something that you cannot control, the other game, so the only thing we could do was to try to give confidence and to help our team-mates to win our game. We knew that a draw or a win we would qualify. That‚Äôs the only thing we could control.‚Äù THE BIGGER PICTURE: Former Real Madrid striker Hugo Sanchez is among those to have suggested that Spain lost on purpose in order to avoid Brazil and to send Germany packing, with the Mexican legend saying: ‚ÄúI was not there and I‚Äôm not in the mind of Luis Enrique but he had thought about what was the best way to avoid playing Brazil in the quarter-finals.

There have been fitness issues, of course. Gio Reyna's has been a talking point throughout, and will remain so unless he plays significant minutes at some point. Weston McKennie and Sergino Dest, meanwhile, entered the tournament with some reasons for concern. But the U.S. has not faced something of this level just yet as they look ahead to the knockout rounds. Christian Pulisic is dealing with a pelvic contusion, having suffered the injury scoring his heroic goal against Iran. The U.S. is hopeful he'll play, but it isn't a certainty. The same can be said about striker Josh Sargent, who started twice in the group stage. He's dealing with an ankle injury that could keep him out of the game against the Dutch.

The last time Ghana made it to the knockout stages of a World Cup was back in 2010 when a Luis Suarez handball and a missed penalty ended their fairytale. But if the Black Stars win they could go through and sent Uruguay home. For Uruguay the calculations are simple, if they win against a strong Ghana team, they would go through but a loss or a draw would see them leave Qatar. Dieogo Alonso‚Äôs side have had a lackluster tournament opening their account with a goalless draw against South Korea before being triumphed by Portugal in their second fixture. Uruguay would want their forwards to step-up and bag them their first goal in Qatar if they want a chance to qualify for the round of 16. Ghana XI (4-2-3-1): Ati-Zigi; Lamptey, Amartey, Salisu, Baba; Partey, Samed; Kudus, A Ayew, J Ayew; Williams Uruguay XI (4-4-2): Rochet; Olivera, Gimenez, Coates, Varela; Arrascaeta, Valverde, Bentancur, Pellistri; Nunez, Suarez  Ghana are predicted to finish second in the group and they would encounter Brazil on the 6th of December. If Uruguay defeat Ghana, they could secure 2nd spot in the group and would face Brazil on the 6th of December. Which was the best World Cup winning team? Which was the best World Cup winning team?"

I‚Äôd put myself in there. And then I‚Äôd go with a midfielder, I‚Äôd go with Declan Rice. He protects everything doesn‚Äôt he. We‚Äôll just let Ronnie and H [Kane] go and score the goals, and we‚Äôll do the defending.‚Äù THE BIGGER PICTURE: Maguire is working with Kane, Stones and Rice as England look to chase down a global crown in Qatar, but he will not be a team-mate of Ronaldo once the showpiece in the Middle East comes to a close as United have ripped up the Portuguese‚Äôs contract at Old Trafford and released him as a free agent.

There is still plenty of firepower on their books ‚Äì with the likes of Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial, Antony and Jadon Sancho competing for minutes ‚Äì but the expectation is that the Red Devils will dip back into the transfer market at some point in order to acquire another proven goalscorer. WHAT THEY SAID: Quizzed by MUTV on who United could target, club legend Scholes said of star turns catching the eye at RB Leipzig and PSV: ‚ÄúI think there's a couple of forwards they might look at. The kid at RB Leipzig that's been linked with Chelsea, Nkunku. Centre forward is obviously the big position that needs filling. We have Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford who can both play there, but I think Marcus prefers being out wide and Anthony's injury record isn't great. January might be too soon (to replace Ronaldo), they're probably looking at next summer now, but I do think there are players out there. ‚ÄúThe lad at PSV, Gakpo, is doing well for the Netherlands at the World Cup and I think Ten Hag has been interested in him before.

Ronaldo had already made one push for the exits over the summer, only to see the transfer deadline pass with no deal done, and Stam believes the Portuguese knew exactly what he was doing from that point after seeing game time limited under Erik ten Hag. WHAT THEY SAID: Former United defender Stam, speaking in association with Football Betting, has told GOAL of the long-running Ronaldo saga: ‚ÄúHe did it on purpose. There was a strategy behind it in terms of ‚Äòhow are we going to organise this so that I can leave the club?‚Äô From the beginning to now, you could see where it was going. Not playing, not being in the team, being subbed, not being used, walking away and then saying, from United‚Äôs point of view as well, we spoke about it and the discussion about who is right in all these situations. In everything that has been going on, it‚Äôs been arranged in how it needs to be to leave the club. The next step was to give an interview and say certain things that is going to blow up and eventually you are going to be leaving. It‚Äôs not a good situation. I always questioned the way of working with him and how it started when he joined the club, how the conversations went with Ronaldo, then the decision making about not using him. And from Ronaldo as well, when he said ‚ÄòI want to leave and go somewhere else‚Äô, maybe they could have come to an agreement and parted ways at the beginning of the season. Then it kept dragging on and now with this interview, he knew by saying certain things and making comments about the manager and the club and the owners, they needed to let him go.‚Äù THE BIGGER PICTURE: Pressed further on whether Ronaldo had started to believe that he was bigger than the club, Stam ‚Äì who formed part of United‚Äôs legendary 1999 treble-winning squad ‚Äì added: ‚ÄúThe club is the most important thing. He knows that, his agent knows that, everybody knows that. The thing is that everybody also knows that Ronaldo is a very good player and he still is a big player, a big name in the world of football, a big influence in everything he does with attention on him. He feels that he is still very important, was very important or could be very important for the club ‚Äì which in a way I agree with ‚Äì but the manager is making different decisions. How those things have been dealt with, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs been good. Maybe from the club, they could have done it a bit differently, but also from Ronaldo and his point of view, he should have known better and how to handle certain situations. If you are that experienced, have played so many games and won so many trophies ‚Äì as an individual as well ‚Äì both parties could have solved the situation better.‚Äù IN THREE PHOTOS: WHAT NEXT? Ronaldo is currently on 2022 World Cup duty with his country, with Portugal set to be back in action against South Korea on Friday after already booking their place in the last 16, and a decision on his future ‚Äì amid talk of interest from England, the USA and Saudi Arabia ‚Äì is not expected to be made until another bid for global glory in Qatar has come to a close, although Al-Nassr are believed to have tabled a huge offer.

The England forward, who is currently on 2022 World Cup duty, has said: ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt actually been asked about that and let me just address it.

151,'Building a platform that didn't exist' ‚Äì Why La Liga is backing a unique project in Cameroon,"After years of work, La Ligue D'Egalite is aiming to bring more opportunities to young people in one of Africa's most successful footballing nations."," ‚ÄúUnique‚Äù, something ‚Äúthat has never happened before‚Äù. And it‚Äôs all taking place in Yaounde, Cameroon. Five years ago, a project began to develop a structure that could get more kids into football in one of Africa‚Äôs most successful nations. Today, it is a fully operational league ‚Äì La Ligue D'Egalite, 'the equality league' ‚Äì and is endorsed by La Liga, one of football‚Äôs biggest brands. When GOAL asks Tresor Penku, the Spanish league's delegate in Cameroon and Central Africa, what it was about the idea that so appealed to him, he doesn‚Äôt have to think twice to answer. ‚ÄúBuilding a platform that didn't exist in the country,‚Äù he replies. ‚ÄúIn many African countries, you have a lot of tournaments around the place, but for boys. You have leagues around the communities, but for boys. You have parents who will say, 'Oh, my daughter loves football, but can't play because it's with the boys.' ‚ÄúSo, I was like, 'Oh, this is actually interesting, because we have many young girls who really want to play football. But where do they play football? Why do they play? How do they play?‚Äô ‚ÄúNow, even if we have been able to impact close to 600, many still want to play and we are discovering that. ""The growth has also been due to the fact that there are many young girls out there who need a platform to play football and we are just giving them the opportunity.‚Äù Cameroon is a football mad nation and one of Africa‚Äôs very best.  Five-time champions on the continent on the men‚Äôs side, their run to the quarter-finals of the 1990 World Cup and Roger Milla‚Äôs dancing is a fondly recalled memory for many outside of the country, never mind within, while Samuel Eto'o is arguably the continent's greatest ever footballer. The women‚Äôs team is growing in stature, too, reaching the final of the Africa Cup of Nations in 2014 and 2016, and the knockout stages of the last two World Cup tournaments.  A look through their squad and you‚Äôll see top clubs represented, with Ajara Nchout at Inter while Michaela Abam and Estelle Johnson play in one of the world's best leagues, in the United States. But look at the opportunities available to the children in Cameroon wanting to be the next Eto‚Äôo or Nchout and you'll see that the are limited ‚Äì particularly for girls. It was just under a decade ago, then, that the Cameroonian Football Federation reached out to Jordan Cone, who was working at an international school and coaching a women‚Äôs team in Yaounde ‚Äì the country‚Äôs capital. They wanted his help to develop a structure to get more kids into the game. The idea that initiative spawned is called Petrichor, an association model that offers support to local clubs in a variety of ways ‚Äì from equipment and a league structure, to coaching education and pitch improvements. ‚ÄúWhat happens [in Cameroon] is there's a handful of tournaments per year that random people put on. A club might say, 'Hey, we're going to run a tournament in this community in a few months,'"" Paul Dreisbach, the project‚Äôs co-founder, tells GOAL. ‚ÄúWord gets out, academies get all the players they can and they'll practise for a few months, go play in the tournament and then, once it's over, nothing happens for another six months or a year, until there's another tournament. ‚ÄúIf there are a few good players in that tournament, some of these clubs might see them and say, 'Hey, can you come for a trial?' But that's the extent of youth pathways and development right now in Cameroon. ‚ÄúThere are a few select academies that work with exclusive numbers, where they'll host try-outs and only work with 20 kids, but there hasn't been anything like this kind of decentralised and community-based organic entry into the game, because we tried to just get kids playing. ‚ÄúAs far as the girls' league, that's never happened before. It just doesn't exist.‚Äù When Cone ‚Äì who grew up in West Africa but went to university with Dreisbach in the United States ‚Äì was contacted by the federation, he picked up the phone to ring his friend across the Atlantic.  ‚ÄúHey, do you want to help me start something?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúI'm not exactly sure how to work it.‚Äù What followed was a lot of groundwork, building relationships in Cameroon, which has been imperative to the success of La Ligue D'Egalite's launch. ‚ÄúI think because we're flipping the script a bit and being very inclusive of the wider community, working with people and investing into local leaders that were already doing this work, that's where it's a bit unique and gaining some attention because, as far as I know, I haven't seen something like this before,‚Äù Dreisbach says. At first, it was just about football. But then Dreisbach connected with Lola Ogunbote, who works for Goals for Girls, an American non-governmental organisation with a mission statement of ‚Äúuniting girls through football to lead community change‚Äù. ""I was like, 'Well, if you're doing the football side, what's the support? How are they being mentored? What's the messaging that's going on there?'"" Ogunbote tells GOAL of her first interaction with Dreisbach. ‚ÄúHe was like, 'Oh, it's kind of just football at this time.' I said, 'Well, that's great but we could also come in and help in terms of getting the messaging across about who they are, their values, what they want from life, how they can make change in their communities.  ""'We can provide that leadership, that female empowerment around sport element on top of what you're offering.'‚Äù It was a perfect fit. Ogunbote and her team spoke to female coaches in the area to understand what messaging was needed for girls in Yaounde, came up with a curriculum and added it to the project. It's not the only addition to this programme that deals with more than just playing football. Dreisbach is able to point to a number of ideas and projects in the works that aim to explore different avenues in sport, such as journalism or data analysis, and give young people the chance to open more doors in their future. There is also a lot of work going on behind the scenes to make these clubs in Cameroon self-sufficient, so Petrichor's work is no longer needed. Things were tough to start with, Dreisbach admits.  ""We're talking with families and communities about releasing their girls to come play and focusing just on them, and it's been difficult,‚Äù he explains. But, now, all of this is having quite an impact in the country. ‚ÄúThere are many parents who are resistant to the fact that their girls play football,‚Äù Penku says. ‚ÄúOthers will see what is happening and maybe become more flexible at that point. If their young girl wants to play football, they'll say, 'Go for it!' ‚ÄúThey're coming more and more. It's actually becoming an event for communities. Every weekend, when there's a nice day, not only players come ‚Äì they want to come with their friends, with their families.‚Äù ‚ÄúThree hundred to four hundred girls, literally every week now, can go and play in a league,‚Äù Ogunbote, whose Goals for Girls project isn‚Äôt partnered with La Liga but simply working with Petrichor, says. ‚ÄúThat's phenomenal. I look at that and I think, 'Well, if that's the only contribution I can make in this life, I'm very happy with that.' ""I'm happy to be a part of such a movement in a country that doesn't normally champion girls participating in sport.‚Äù What's next, then? Penku explains that the aim is not to produce professional players like an academy, but it would be a bonus on top of everything else that is going on.  The girls can see that is possible, too, with Cameroon international Catherine Mbengono a regular visitor to those benefiting from Petrichor‚Äôs work. ""That's definitely a great connection for them to see as a role model like, 'Whoa, you came from the same community I live in right now ‚Äì and look at you,'"" Dreisbach explains.  ""That's definitely a big help for us and, along with that exposure, we want to help provide more role models like that.‚Äù Another is Estelle Johnson, who plays for Cameroon and Gotham in the NWSL. She was ‚Äúimmediately drawn‚Äù to what Petrichor is doing and has sent messages to the girls along the way. ‚ÄúThese opportunities are very important not only for the future of our national team but also because participation in football and sports is important to build character, confidence, teamwork and many other life skills,‚Äù she tells GOAL.  ‚ÄúFootball taught me about life and I love seeing the girls have the opportunity to get a taste of that. ‚ÄúMy message to the young, amazing footballers of Cameroon is to follow your heart, dream big, and be consistent with your work. ""If football is something that you want to do, every time you show up to play, be ready. Play hard, enjoy it and never let anyone tell you that your dreams are impossible."" The goal might not be to produce the next Mbengono or Johnson, but who knows? With accessibility and visibility like this, girls in Cameroon have opportunities that simply weren‚Äôt there before. Maybe the next rising star from this great footballing nation will start their story in La Ligue D'Egalite."

Hansi Flick‚Äôs side were able to see off Costa Rica 4-2 in their final Group E fixture, but an opening 2-1 defeat to Japan proved costly as the Samurai Blue pulled off a shock victory over Spain to progress in the simultaneous game.

Of course, as Germany, we have to have different aspirations, so we have to take a good look at ourselves. We just didn't manage to do our best as a group, or maybe individually.

155,'That man will never set foot in Perugia again!' - Ahn Jung-hwan & the golden goal that ruined Italian football,South Korea coach Guus Hiddink told the striker before the 2002 World Cup that the tournament would change his life - and it did.," Ahn Jung-hwan endured a traumatic childhood. Raised by his grandmother after the loss of both of his parents, he never had much growing up. He only started playing football as a kid because his local club offered their players bread and milk. It's perhaps unsurprising, then, that even after turning professional, his post-retirement goals were modest. ""I hope I will be running a small grocery store,"" he revealed, ""and just living in comfort."" Happily, Jung-hwan is doing quite well for himself, albeit not as a green-grocer. He has instead established himself as one of the most famous broadcasters in South Korea. He even has his own YouTube channel. And his success is rooted in one of the most famous goals, in one of the most infamous matches, in World Cup history. An entire book could be written about South Korea's meeting with Italy in Daejeon in 2002. In Italy, the referee, Byron Moreno, remains renowned as one of the biggest villains in football history. Jung-hwan, meanwhile, is remembered for his Golden Goal ‚Äì and the pathetic reaction it provoked from his employer, Perugia president Luciano Gaucci. At the time, the striker was coming off two underwhelming seasons in Serie A, which had featured just five goals in 30 appearances. His confidence was low and he had actually begun the World Cup sitting on the bench. However, South Korea boss Guus Hiddink retained the utmost faith in Jung-hwan. He told him that the tournament would change his life ‚Äì and it did. He came off the bench to score in the group-stage clash with USA, earning his nation a precious point and himself a place in the starting line-up. His most significant contribution, though, would come against his adopted home.  Jung-hwan later confessed that he felt Italy had no chance against a star-studded Italy. However, the last-16 showdown united Korea like no other match, before or since. The Taeguek Warriors even received support from their neighbours to the north, while the fans that descended upon Daejeon on June 18, 2002 revelled in reminding the Azzurri of one of their most humiliating World Cup defeats. 'Again 1966' was the message from the stands, a reference to Italy's loss to North Korea at Goodison Park 38 years previously. Jung-hwan should have opened the scoring, too, but his early penalty was saved by Gigi Buffon. So, when Christian Vieri broke the deadlock, it appeared that a team that also contained Francesco Totti, Alessandro Del Piero and Paolo Maldini would coast to victory. However, Italy's coach, the notoriously pragmatic Giovanni Trapattoni, instead tried to see out the game, and the Azzurri almost inevitably paid the price, with Seol Ki-Hyeon equalising with just two minutes of normal time remaining. By this stage, Moreno's performance ‚Äì and apparent lack of fitness ‚Äì was already coming under scrutiny, and it only intensified when Totti was harshly shown a second yellow card for simulation. Then, with just three minutes to go before penalties, the ball was swung into the Azzurri area. There appeared to be only one winner: Maldini, arguably the greatest defender of all time. Jung-wan, though, got the jump on him ‚Äì literally. He later revealed, ""I actually thought I jumped too early and wouldn't be able to head the ball. But Maldini got his timing wrong because I jumped first. That was a big stroke of luck for me."" There was nothing fortuitous about the finish, though, with Jung-hwan heading home to send Korea into raptures, and Italy into meltdown. Jung-hwan became an instant icon. ""I remember there were so many fans waiting for me that I couldn't go outside,"" he told JoongAng. Indeed, his Golden Goal had generated a wave of euphoria that South Korea rode all the way until the last four. However, in Italy, there was uproar, with many believing Moreno's handling of the game to be evidence of match-fixing. The Gazzetta dello Sport, meanwhile, claimed that this was the latest demonstration of a FIFA-led persecution of the Azzurri. Gaucci, though, focused his frustration on Jung-hwan. ""That man will never set foot in Perugia again,"" he fumed. ""He was a phenomenon only when he played against Italy! ""I am a nationalist and I regard such behaviour not only as an affront to Italian pride but also an offence to a country which two years ago opened its doors to him. ""I have no intention of paying a salary to someone who has ruined Italian football."" The notoriously erratic Gaucci quickly backed down but Jung-hwan was understandably outraged, blaming his boss for creating a toxic atmosphere which he says resulted in his car being vandalised and local news reports of death threats from the mafia. ""It was almost like I had ended my entire football career with that one goal,"" he told JoongAng. Jung-hwan refused to play for Perugia again and what followed was a messy contractual dispute which scuppered his hopes of joining Premier League outfit Blackburn Rovers. In the end, a Japanese firm agreed to pay the ‚Ç¨3.8 million (¬£3.3m/$3.8m) that Gaucci was demanding in compensation, and the forward joined J-League outfit Shimizu S-Pulse. He later acknowledged, ""My life could have been different if I had played in the Premier League, but a lot of people have told me that they were very happy because I was part of the 2002 squad, and I always tell them, no, you made me happy. ""I think that $3.8m is the price I paid for the respect and love I have received from the people."" Jung-hwan, then, has no regrets, and rightly so. The controversy which surrounded South Korea-Italy, and the subsequent fallout, had absolutely nothing to do with him. He did absolutely nothing wrong. As he said himself in an interview with FIFA+, ""There's no law stating I'm not allowed to score against Italy. When I look back, I would swap my whole career for that one goal.""

Hansi Flick's team were dominant from the beginning of the match as they chased the vital victory they needed to surely put them through. They did their bit and got the three points but with Japan incredibly beating Spain it wasn't enough. The tension was evident. Germany buckled initially as Costa Rica found a way back into the game, with Manuel Neuer and Antonio Rudiger producing moments of madness to allow their opponents to take a shock lead. Serge Gnabry and Kai Havertz were there to rescue Flick's side, however, with the Bayern Munich winger chipping in with the opening goal and a vital assist, while the Chelsea forward came off the bench to score twice.

In a World Cup group containing two former winners of the illustrious prize, alongside two nations who are largely considered minnows in the game, the very real possibility that the two former winners could go out was simply incomprehensible. But alas, that reality came to be. At least for a while. Spain strolled into half-time with a 1-0 lead and looked comfortable. However, a rally from Japan saw them burst into a 2-1 lead after the break thanks to the iconic Ritsu Doan and a rather controversial strike from Ao Tanaka. Fair or not, Japan had a lead against the 2010 world champions, having already beaten the 2014 champions in Qatar. And with Germany stuttering against Costa Rica elsewhere in Group E, there was a (very) brief moment where both Japan and Costa Rica were advancing at the expense of Spain and Germany. Kai Havertz fired in for 2-2 to ensure that didn't happen, which ultimately spared Spain's blushes as it ensured they progressed to the knockout stages, albeit in second place.

Germany were the other victim of the Japanese efficiency, falling to a 2-1 defeat in the opening group game and leaving them with a mountain to climb. In the final group game against Costa Rica, Hansi Flick's side were leading 1-0 at half-time, with Spain also leading Japan by the same scoreline simultaneously. Germany were progressing to the Round of 16 as things stood, However, an inspiring second half comeback from Japan meant that Germany crashed out of the group stage of a World Cup for the second successive time, even if they managed a 4-2 win. Costa Rica's hammering at the hands of Spain meant that they needed two wins out of two to progress to the Round of 16. They did manage to beat table toppers Japan 2-1 in their next game. The Costa Ricans were also leading Germany 2-1 at the 70th minute in their final group game, taking them to second place in the group as things stood then.

173,"Ghana vs Uruguay: Luis Suarez, a handball & bitter World Cup rivalry explained",Luis Suarez is a figure of hate for some football fans in Ghana and is at the centre of the international rivalry," In the quarter-final of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, Uruguay defeated Ghana in deeply controversial circumstances. The teams played out a 120-minute tie plus penalties and what unfolded during the game laid the groundwork for a fresh international football rivalry. Ghana took the lead on the stroke of half time, through a 40-yard Sulley Muntari thunderbolt, but Diego Forlan levelled the score with a gorgeous free kick just after half-time. So how exactly did Ghana and Uruguay become rivals? GOAL brings you everything you need to know. Why are Uruguay and Ghana rivals in football? Luis Suarez has been cast in the role of chief villain in the Ghana-Uruguay rivalry as, in the closing stages of extra time, after a goalmouth scramble, the Uruguayan striker used both of his hands to block Dominic Adiyah's goal-bound effort. Suarez's deliberate handball prompted an automatic red card and a potentially decisive chance for Ghana in the form of a penalty kick. However, Ghana forward Asamoah Gyan smashed the spot kick off the top of the bar and over. The game subsequently went to penalties and Uruguay emerged as winners, triumphing 4-2 in the shootout. Suarez's behaviour on the pitch, the ultimate rewards for his actions and his conduct in the aftermath incensed the nation of Ghana. Suarez and Uruguay have thus been sticking points for Ghana, so any time they meet, that historic game inevitably casts a shadow. One of the most dramatic #FIFAWorldCup matches we've ever seen üòØHow a handball changed everything for Uruguay and Ghana ‚§µÔ∏è What has been said about the Luis Suarez handball? The Suarez handball is widely considered one of the great sporting injustices perpetrated against Ghana, taking on similar significance as Diego Maradona's infamous 'Hand of God' in the eyes of England supporters, or Thierry Henry's handball for the Republic of Ireland. When asked to recall the events of July 2, 2010, former Ghana defender John Paintsil told the BBC: ""There's no African player who would have done that."" As if to rub salt into the wound, Suarez stopped in the tunnel to watch Ghana's penalty before exiting the pitch and was pictured celebrating with his teammates when Asamoah Gyan missed. The striker later claimed to have ""made the best save of the tournament"", a comment which served to compound the bitterness felt by the Ghana players and their fans. Paintsil said: ""After the penalty was missed you (Suarez) came out and then celebrated like you're on top of the world by hurting people. At least be a professional, feel the pain. Just go to your dressing room and celebrate and then nobody will see it."" On the other hand, Gyan admitted that he would have done the same thing if he was in Suarez's shoes. In an interview with talkSPORT he said: ""I‚Äôm a football player and I do understand the game. Back home, everybody who watched the game, they dislike him. ‚ÄúI always say if I was Suarez I would have done the same thing to save my country. He‚Äôs a hero there. Although people see him as a cheat, he did what he had to do to get his country to the semi-final. ‚ÄúPeople do hate him, but I‚Äôm in the game as well. He did what he had to do to get his country to the semi-final."" Luis Suarez isn't backing down üòà pic.twitter.com/g2DmAJzm8h Did Luis Suarez apologise for his handball vs Ghana? Considering that Suarez appeared to revel in the initial notoriety - claiming that Maradona's hand belonged to him, for example - it is perhaps no surprise that he takes a dim view of the idea that he should have to apologise for the handball.  The former Barcelona and Liverpool star made his feelings on the matter very clear when asked ahead of the last-16 meeting between the teams at the 2022 World Cup. ""I didn't miss the penalty,"" the striker said bluntly when asked about being viewed as 'the devil himself'. ""Maybe if I injured the player I'd apologise, but in this situation I took a red card and the referee gave a penalty. It's not my fault. The player who missed the penalty (Gyan) said he'd do the same. It's not my responsibility to score the penalty"" Indeed, he impressed the idea of moving on, referencing the reconciliation between himself and Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini: ""It's 12 years ago. It's the past. I've played against Chiellini too [who he bit in the 2014 World Cup], and we shook hands."" Which was the best World Cup winning team? Which was the best World Cup winning team?"
174,"Who is Spain's leading all-time top goal scorer? Villa, Raul and La Furia Roja's most lethal strikers",Spain national football team's goalscoring chart consists of some of the greatest superstars in history.," Even though Spain have always had some of the finest talent around in the game at their disposal, their national team traditionally flattered to deceive. Perennial pre-tournament favourites. Perennial post-tournament underachievers. That all changed in 2008. They won the Euros that year, went on to lift the World Cup two years later, only to then successfully defend their European title in 2012. Their brilliant midfield played a massive role in that successful run, with the likes of Xavi and Andres Iniesta dominating play in the middle, but people often underestimate the attacking talent at hand. David Villa was a prolific goalscorer and so was Fernando Torres in his prime. Those two were by no means Spain's first great attackers, though.  There was Raul. Emilio Butragueno. Alfredo Di Stefano. The list goes on and on. But who is Spain's most lethal attacker ever? Let's take a look at the legends leading their all-time goalscoring charts!"
175,Ghana's parliament mocks Harry Maguire in outrageous speech that compares England's World Cup defender to vice president,Harry Maguire was the subject of ridicule in the Ghanaian parliament as MP Isaac Adongo compared the defender to Vice President Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia.," WHAT HAPPENED? The politician took shots at England and Manchester United centre-back Maguire, saying he scores own goals and assists opponents. Adongo said that the nation's vice president is like an economic version of Maguire.  WHAT THEY SAID: ""Harry Maguire, he's a defender. He was tackling everybody and throwing his body everywhere,"" Adongo said. ""He was seen as the best defender in the world. Manchester United went and bought him. He became the biggest threat at the centre of the Manchester United defence, tackling Manchester players and giving assists to opponents. Mr. Speaker, when you see the opponents go to score, Maguire will score for them."" He added: ""Mr. Speaker, you remember in this country we also have an economic Maguire. We're clapping saying this man is the best in managing foreign terms. The same economic Maguire was at Central University delivering lectures on how to restore the value of the Cedi (Ghana's currency). Mr Speaker why we gave this Maguire the opportunity to be at the centre of our defence? He became the rest of our own goals. Our economic Maguire is taking control of the fundamentals of our economy and destroying all of them.""  THE BIGGER PICTURE: Maguire has been heavily criticised for his performances for club and country. The 29-year-old has lost his place in the United starting XI, having made just four Premier League appearances this season. He has started all three of England's World Cup games, but he was mocked by Iran fans who made banners saying the Three Lions would not win the competition as long as he was in the back-line.

Following the bombshell news that Juventus' entire board had resigned on November 28, it now appears that the plot has thickened, with UEFA announcing that the CFCB First Chamber will open an investigation into the club for potential breaches surrounding Club Licensing and Financial Fair Play regulations. WHAT THEY SAID: A statement published to UEFA's website on December 1 reads: ""The CFCB First Chamber has today opened a formal investigation into Juventus FC for potential breaches of the Club Licensing and Financial Fair Play regulations. ""The CFCB First Chamber investigation will focus on the alleged financial violations that were recently made public as a result of the proceedings led by the Italian Companies and Exchange Commission (CONSOB) and the public prosecutor in Turin."" AND WHAT'S MORE: The statement says a prior settlement with Juventus could be nullified : because that agreement ""was concluded on the basis of the financial information previously submitted by the club pertaining to the financial years closing in 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022."" ""In the event that, after conclusion of this investigation, the club‚Äôs financial situation was significantly different from that assessed by the CFCB First Chamber at the time the settlement agreement was concluded, or if new and substantial facts arise or become known, the CFCB First Chamber reserves the right to terminate the settlement agreement, take any legal step it may deem appropriate, and impose disciplinary measures in accordance with the applicable UEFA CFCB Procedural Rules."" THE BIGGER PICTURE: It emerged that Juve's board of directors stepped down as a result of investigations being opened by Italian authorities into the Old Lady's accounts, specifically payments and wages that were supposedly deferred throughout the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Being investigated by a UEFA body now adds to the club's concerns. IN TWO PHOTOS:  WHAT NEXT FOR JUVENTUS?

Luis Enrique‚Äôs Spain had a scintillating start to their World Cup bashing Costa Rica 7-0 in their opening fixture. But La Furia Roja failed to secure themselves a knockout round ticket after conceding in the last minutes of the game against Germany. The Spanish team would like to repeat their heroics against Costa Rica when they face Japan on Thursday. The fixture against Japan could also serve as the perfect opportunity for Luis Enrique to experiment with his bench strength and rest crucial players. A win would mean Spain will retain the top spot in Group E, but a loss could threaten their chances of qualification if Germany beat Costa Rica by a massive margin. But Spain has registered a win against Asian opponents in their previous 5 encounters a streak they would like to continue. After producing one of the biggest upsets against Germany, the Japanese team was handed a shocking defeat by a more determined Costa Rica team. And now if Hajime Moriyasu's team wants to qualify for the knockout stages of the World Cup for the second successive time, they‚Äôll have to conquer the Spanish challenge. A win would see the Blue Samurais qualify sitting at the pinnacle of the group while a draw would mean they would be dependent on the results from the encounter between Germany and Costa Rica. But if Japan lose against Spain, they would be sent home from the group stage despite their tremendous start to the tournament.

Belgium are out of the World Cup following a 0-0 draw with Croatia, who advance from second place in Group F."," In a chaotic week involving reported rifts within the squad and just about all the eyes of the footballing world on them, Belgium's performance was chaotic in all the wrong ways. Roberto Martinez's side crashed out of Qatar 2022 having failed to make it out of the group stages following a lifeless draw with Croatia.  And while ahead of kick-off a draw was good enough to advance, they almost fell behind inside the first minute thanks to a swift kick-off routine involving Luka Modric and Ivan Perisic. In part, that told the story of the game; Croatia weren't sharp enough, but Belgium were even worse, and never looked like actually sustaining a consistent threat. The tempo upped somewhat after the break, but considering Morocco were ahead against Canada, it wasn't anywhere near good enough. Romelu Lukaku coming off the bench to miss as many as four glorious opportunities - the first two of which were open nets - painted a dismal picture of Belgium's reality. With each one squandered, elimination looked more and more inevitable. Eden Hazard being given a handful of minutes in the dying embers was truly the last roll of the dice, but was of course not enough to get the Red Devils - currently second in FIFA's world rankings - over the line and into the World Cup knockout stages.

Youssef En-Nesyri added another goal in the 23rd minute on a fantastic ball from Achraf Hakimi over Canada's back-line, but John Herdman's side pulled one back before half-time thanks to a Nayef Aguerd own goal. Despite Canada's enthusiasm in the second half, the equalising goal never came, although they did come close as a shot bounced near the line before being cleared away. It's Morocco's first last-16 appearance at a World Cup since 1986. THE MVP: A few months ago, Ziyech wasn't even part of this Morocco team, having controversially retired from the international game amid a feud with former coach Vahid Halilhodzic. On Thursday, though, he scored the goal that effectively sent his team to the round of 16, even if it came with a little help from Canada's back-line. THE BIG LOSER: Milan Borjan's catastrophic error helped set the tone within the first four minutes. He wasn't helped out by Alistair Johnston's poor back-pass, but Canada's goalkeeper got a little too cute with his touch, handing Ziyech the first goal.

Morocco were one of the surprises of the group stage as they registered back-to-back wins in the group stage against Belgium and Canada to top Group F with 7 points. They will face the second-placed team from Group E. Croatia had the most incredible run of form in Russia in 2018 as they reached the final, only to lose against pre-tournament France after a thrilling match. This time around too, they have qualified for the Round of 16 by finishing second in the group with 5 points (W1 D2). Former world number one Belgium will probably be the team that disappointed the most as they shockingly failed to get past the group stage, collecting just 4 points. They needed a win in their final group game against Croatia, but could only manage to grab a point after Romelu Lukaku couldn't convert straightforward chances in the second half.  Canada qualified for the World Cup after a gap of 36 years, but could not get ahead of any other team in the group as they finished with two losses and a draw."

191,World Cup MVP Adams so much more than 'the American Kante' to the USMNT,The American captain dominated all three group-stage games at Qatar 2022 in a way that few could have expected," It's not often that a 23-year-old soccer player finds himself at the center of a geopolitical firestorm but, ultimately, there aren't many 23-year-old soccer players quite like Tyler Adams. Ahead of the U.S. men's national team's clash with Iran, Adams was hounded by a reporter about perceived disrespect of the opponent's country. His pronunciation of Iran was corrected before Adams was asked how the U.S. can criticize the political arrest in Iran while African Americans, like Adams, still deal with discrimination stateside. What came next was a moment of grace, humility and maturity. Adams apologized for any offense, going on to discuss his own experiences with discrimination and racism. He pointed to progress and the need to find it no matter what country or culture you represent. He never faltered, showing wisdom in the face of criticism and poise in the face of chaos. In the end, a situation that could have been a nightmare was quickly diffused. That's what Adams does, right? Diffuses bad situations. On the field, off the field, it's simply what he does. And that's why there has not been a bigger presence at this World Cup than Adams, the USMNT youngster that is rapidly becoming a star on and off the pitch. tyler adams gave a classy response after being called out for mispronouncing 'iran' üëè #soccer #usmnt #worldcup #football #tyleradams #usavsiran #fyp  Finally, Adams is getting his flowers from the outside world. A talented young defensive midfielder, he's taken his game to an otherworldly level at this World Cup, undoubtedly the USMNT's best player in Qatar so far. And, off the field, he's taken on the role of captain with elegance, leading from the very front. He's always been one of many leaders on this USMNT and you could say he still is. But, whether it's on that podium or in the middle of the field, Adams has stepped up to become the face of this national team. I don't know whether it's the captaincy or not,"" defender Antonee Robinson said of Adams, ""but I've said to him, since he's come here, he's really upped his level even more than I already know. That energy he brings in midfield and that leadership, it affects all of us and keeps us all in check. He sets the standard."" Often overlooked when compared to his superstar team-mates, there's no doubt that Adams' play at the World Cup has more than earned his spot among them. He leads the World Cup in tackles, with nine in 10 attempts, as has routinely put out any fires faced by the USMNT. It's a key reason the U.S. have yet to allow a goal from open play so far this tournament. Adams, as usual, has been all effort. Data says he's run more than any other player in the tournament so far, covering more ground than seemingly possible. Every time a bad situation has popped up, Adams has been there to handle it, no matter where he has been on the field. Most importantly, though, is that Adams' weaknesses haven't shown at all. We've all known he can tackle and run, but his passing has long been seen as a weak point. Perhaps not anymore. He completed 100 percent of his passes against England, the best team the U.S. has faced thus far. He made 17 line-breaking actions against Iran, helping the U.S. break down a team content to bunker for the first half. The 'American Kante' comparisons are a bit premature but, make no mistake, Adams is playing at that sort of level in Qatar. He, alongside Weston McKennie and Yunus Musah, are dictating how games are played, with the USMNT midfield standing out in each of the three games so far. None have stood out more than Adams, though, despite the fact that he's the one doing the behind-the-scenes dirty work. He was named the USMNT's captain prior to the tournament and, my goodness, did Gregg Berhalter get it right. What more could you ask for from a captain? It's Adams that sets the tone, as many of his team-mates have said. And it's Adams that personifies this team: young, brash and unafraid of whatever is in their path. That is unless the thing in their path is an arachnid! ""England are still a big team at the end of the day,"" he said prior to the match against the Three Lions, ""but the intimidation factor? I wouldn't say there are many things out there that intimidate me, other than spiders!"" It's an attitude that Adams has embodied since the first moment he came into the American public's consciousness. For many, his first real moment in the spotlight actually came in a friendly, as he leapt over John Terry to help a team of New York Red Bulls youth players take down Chelsea in a 2015 friendly. ‚ÄúPlaying with players like Diego Costa, [Eden] Hazard, I‚Äôve seen them in a World Cup,"" a 16-year-old Adams said on that day. ""It‚Äôs an unbelievable feeling stepping on the same field as them. It‚Äôs almost like you don‚Äôt belong, but there‚Äôs a reason you‚Äôre on the field with them."" Then-Red Bulls boss Jesse Marsch echoed those sentiments: ""He‚Äôs specifically a player that is not afraid. We‚Äôve liked him from day one. He was our first young signing and we think he has a really big future.‚Äù That future, ultimately, included that World Cup that Adams has been dreaming about for all of these years. And, just as he made that friendly his moment, he's making this tournament in Qatar his as well. The task will get more difficult now, though. After topping Iran, the U.S. will now look ahead to a clash with the Netherlands in the last 16, putting them against a team that is among the best in the world, even if they haven't quite looked it yet in Qatar. Adams will no doubt be key. He'll likely be used to harass Frenkie de Jong and limit in-form Cody Gakpo, scorer of three goals in as many World Cup games. But if the Adams that showed up in the group stage is still there in the knockouts, the U.S. will like their chances. After the win over Iran, Adams was singled out by Berhalter as the team's standout performer. He was presented with a game ball, not just for his efforts against Iran, but for his heroic efforts throughout the group stage. ""I think this player played very good today,"" Berhalter said, ""but when I look at the body of work over the three games, he's been absolutely crushing it: Tyler Adams."" In the knockout, anything can happen. pic.twitter.com/nwJqbyMZRV He's crushed it in every way imaginable, helping elevate his team and his own profile in the process. There's no doubt that clubs around the world will have been left stunned by Adams, who may not be long for Leeds United if the U.S. can keep this World Cup run-up. That's for the future, though. Next up is the Netherlands, and another chance to write World Cup history. Only one man, Claudio Reyna, has captained the USMNT to a knockout round win, coming all the way back in 2002 when Adams was just three years old. Can the USMNT midfielder be the second? ""It's an opportunity for us,"" Adams said. ""It's gonna be an amazing game. We've obviously played against good competition here like England and the Netherlands could be another favorite to win the World Cup. They've done really well with how they navigated through their group phase of the tournament so far with some amazing players. We're gonna have to be ready for that game."" It'll be tough to bet against the USMNT, even if odds are against them. So far, Adams and co. have stared down every challenge. Wales, England, Iran. World Cup qualifying chaos, general inexperience, rogue press conferences. Adams, though, has shown he won't back down from any of it. Except maybe those damn spiders.

The Uruguayan believes the same could be said for Felix, who could ""increase his performance"" away from Atletico, with United among those being strongly linked with his services. WHAT THEY SAID: ""Joao Felix is a very good player, he is young and has a lot of quality,"" Forlan told reporters after watching Portugal beat Uruguay in the 2022 World Cup group stage. ""They paid a lot of money for him and he has not been playing as expected, but he is still very young.

196,"Martino's gone, but can anyone fix Mexico before the 2026 World Cup?","El Tri will pin its failures in Qatar on the departing head coach, but the problems run much deeper than that"," So ends the era of Tata Martino. It ended on Wednesday night around midnight at Lusail Stadium. And it ended as expected: with Martino showered by boos from a Mexico fanbase that turned on him long ago. He announced his departure soon after. Going forward, that fanbase will endlessly debate the next step. They'll discuss Martino's potential replacement, whether that's Miguel Herrera, Guillermo Almada, Antonio Mohamed or one of the countless other candidates that will be linked to the job. But the fact is that Mexico's national team is in need of fixing. Martino couldn't do it alone; can anyone? Mexico's quest for that fifth game, 'El Quinto Partido', came to a disastrous end on Wednesday. Despite a 2-1 win over Saudi Arabia, El Tri hadn't done enough to overtake Poland, who held onto second spot thanks to goal difference as Group C went right down to the wire. However, Mexico's failure didn't occur on that balmy night in Qatar. It didn't even come during the two games prior, both of which saw El Tri squander chances to add points. No, Mexico's failures have been going on for some time. This wasn't a one-off; it was the latest symptom of an ongoing problem. Martino was no doubt part of that problem. Despite the fanfare that came with his hiring, it was clear that the fanbase had turned on the ex-Barcelona boss. And, in many ways, they had reason to. Of course, El Tri fans are often too harsh on their national team, a program that is not among the elite no matter how much they believe it should be. But there were real reasons to criticize Martino, whose tactics never seemed to work in big games and whose roster selections left many enraged on the road to Qatar. Forget the fact that Carlos Vela and Javier 'Chicharito' Hernandez were left at home, although few Mexico fans will. But you add in Santiago Gimenez and Diego Lainez's absences, two players that could have been part of the national team's future, and you see why frustration would build with Martino. And then there's the loss to Argentina, Martino's home country. He was criticized for his tactics, which saw him park the bus in a big way against Lionel Messi, the man he used to coach for club and country. But most of all he was criticized for his attitude, with many fans believing Martino was nowhere near as heartbroken as they were. As mentioned, though, Martino was just one problem. It all lies deeper than that. Mexico's team, as it stands, is not good enough and, most importantly, not young enough. While young U.S. men's national team and Canada squads lifted their countries into the World Cup, Mexico showed up in Qatar with up to eight players over 30 expected to play key roles. That includes all three strikers - Raul Jimenez, Rogelio Funes Mori and Henry Martin - none of whom performed particularly well in Qatar. ""At least when I played we passed this phase,"" said Mexican legend Cuauhtemoc Blanco, who called for Marcelo Bielsa to be named as Martino's replacement. ""I think they lacked a little more courage and desire in the last play, but that's football."" It all points to a deeper problem: Mexican soccer just isn't allowing its talent to reach the same level of a Chicharito or Vela. The players that are headed to Europe are few and far between. Long gone are the days where Chicharito, Vela, Andres Guardado, Miguel Layun, Hector Moreno and Hector Herrera were playing in top leagues. These days, of the World Cup call-ups, only Guardado, Jimenez, Hirving Lozano, Edson Alvarez and Erick Gutierrez are playing at the top European level, with only two of those players on the right side of 30. There were five players under the age of 24 on Mexico's World Cup squad. Three of them combined to play 17 total minutes. The point is that Mexico isn't exporting talent in the way they used to because Mexican players have become far too valuable to Liga MX teams. As a result, only the elite, players like Jimenez and Lozano, are being sold for their market values with the solid-to-good players being held in Liga MX due to the lack of major transfer fees. That, in many ways, has held El Tri back. Liga MX players have always been a solid foundation of the squad, but never have there been so many in the XI. And never have there been so many on the wrong side of 30 playing key roles for the national team. That's a problem that will, ultimately, fall to Yon de Luisa, the federation president, and Mikel Arriola, the Liga MX chief, to solve. And the World Cup in Qatar is not the only failure of the federation in recent years. Both the men's and women's failed to qualify for the Paris Olympics, while the women also failed to qualify for the World Cup. You can also add in the men's teams failures in the Gold Cup and Nations League for good measure. Both executives have made the federation and national team loads of money and expanded their reach, but both have a lot of work to do to change the direction of the national team program. GROUP C WITH A BOX OFFICE ENDING üçø pic.twitter.com/UfvTLVvDgw That starts with a coach, and though Martino was a problem sure, those two will have many more big decisions to make. Mexico's national team is falling behind, not just their local rivals but the rest of the world. Their experience in Qatar showed how far they'd fallen, with El Tri failing to advance from the group for the first time in eight tournaments. They'll look to right the ship on home soil in 2026, which will come faster than many will expect. We're only three-and-a-half years out from that World Cup, with El Tri suddenly needing to rebuild a national team program on the fly before what should be - and still could be - a defining moment in the country's history. The clock is ticking, and 2026 will be here before you know it. What will El Tri look like by the time it rolls around? Which was the best World Cup winning team?

Croatia will be confident of their chances of making it to the next round after their victory over Canada. Belgium however will have to bring their A-game as even a draw could see them miss out on the Round of 16. Belgium's performances in this World Cup have been underwhelming considering the star-studded squad they boast. They will be hoping their current two-win streak against Croatia and star forward Romelu Lukaku's return will give them the added boost necessary to overcome the odds. Croatia were absolutely dominant in their 4-1 comeback victory against Canada. The 2018 finalists have a stellar record in World Cup group stage matches currently (4 wins in 5 games) and will be hoping to make it past Belgium without breaking much sweat.

199,Canada vs Morocco : Lineups and LIVE updates,Canada fight for pride in the encounter against a high-flying Moroccan outfit," Morocco faces Canada in the last encounter of Group F in Qatar. While the Maple Leafs have been knocked out of the tournament, the Atlas Lions' fairytale has been nothing short of a blockbuster. Morocco has their fate in their own hands if they manage to win or at least pick up a point against Canada. They currently sit in the second spot in the table and would like to go through the knockout phase with a comprehensive performance. Walid Regragui‚Äôs side has turned out to be a surprise package in Qatar drawing against 2018 finalists Croatia and then beating Belgium in their previous fixture. And if they don‚Äôt lose by a scintillating margin against Canada, they would go through despite other results. For Canada, this edition of the World Cup could serve as the perfect opportunity to prepare themselves. Although they have already been knocked out, the Canadian side has shown some resilience and does possess some exciting talent going into the 2026 World Cup. They challenged a lackluster Belgium outfit in their opening encounter but were unfortunate to lose the game despite dominating the game. John Herdman would look to guide Canada to their first World Cup victory as they‚Äôll look to leave Qatar providing some entertainment for their traveling fans. Canada XI (3-4-3): Borjan; Johnston, Steven Vitoria, Miller; Adekugbe, Osorio, Kaye, Davies; Buchanan, Larin, Hoilett Morocco XI (4-3-3): Bounou; Hakimi, Aguerd, Saiss, Mazraoui; Ounahi, Amrabat, Sabiri; Ziyech, En-Nesyri, Boufal  If Morocco finishes at the top of Group F, they'll face Germany or Costa Rica on December 6th.

Rice has revealed his desire to one day challenge for the Premier League title and play Champions League football. The West Ham midfielder admitted that seeing his England colleagues go on to achieve big things in the game has made him hungry for more, as he admitted ""you only get one career"". WHAT THEY SAID: When asked whether playing in Qatar has given him new aspirations in the league and in Europe, Rice said in a press conference: ‚ÄúYeah, 100 per cent. For the last two or three years I have been saying that. I have been playing consistently well for [my] club and I feel like I really want to keep pushing.  ""I see my friends here who are playing in the Champions League and for big trophies... you only get one career and at the end of your career you want to look back at what you have won and the biggest games you have played in. I am really ambitious.‚Äù THE BIGGER PICTURE: At 23 years of age, Rice has already made 215 appearances for the Hammers, scoring 11 goals and providing 11 assists in that time.

201,PSG to offer Messi contract extension after 2022 World Cup amid Barcelona and Inter Miami transfer talk,GOAL can confirm that Paris Saint-Germain will present Lionel Messi with a formal contract extension offer after the World Cup.," WHAT'S HAPPENING? Messi initially joined PSG on a two-year deal in August 2021, with that agreement including the option for an extra year. The Argentina superstar helped the club to the Ligue 1 title in his debut season and has started 2022-23 in electrifying fashion, as he is still considered a vital part of the squad. GOAL understands that PSG have informed Messi that they will offer him a new two-year contract after the international break as a reward for his performances. THE BIGGER PICTURE: Messi has been strongly linked with a return to Barcelona in recent weeks, while a potential move to MLS outfit Inter Miami has also been mooted. However, GOAL can confirm that a transfer next summer is highly unlikely given no concrete negotiations have taken place with either club at this stage. AND WHAT'S MORE: Messi is waiting until after the World Cup to make a final decision on his future, but it appears that PSG are in a strong position to retain his services through to 2025. The 35-year-old will be expected to play a part in the club's first game back against Strasbourg in Ligue 1 on December 28. STORY IN THREE PHOTOS   WHAT NEXT FOR MESSI?

In a now infamous World Cup moment, Suarez stopped a header from Dominic Adiyiah on the line using his hands, with Asamoah Gyan blazing the resulting penalty off the bar and over. Having been sent off, the Uruguayan then erupted into raucous celebrations near the tunnel as Ghana were later eliminated on penalties, although Suarez feels he has nothing to be sorry for. WHAT THEY SAID: When asked about the events of 2010 during a press conference, the 35-year-old replied bluntly: ""I didn't miss the penalty. It's not my fault."" THE BIGGER PICTURE: The forward, who has scored 68 goals in 136 caps for Uruguay, urged the Ghanaians to move on, arguing: ""It's 12 years ago. It's the past. I've played against [Giorgio] Chiellini too [who he bit in the 2014 World Cup], and we shook hands."" IN THREE PHOTOS:  DID YOU KNOW? Ghana have become the first team to record consecutive 3-2 results at the World Cup (for or against) since Uruguay in 2010, and the fourth side overall to do so (also Germany in 1994 and Switzerland in 1934).

The French international is currently leading the goal-scoring charts in the 2022 World Cup with three goals to his name. However, former England international Walcott believes that Mbappe's mettle will be tested if he goes up against Manchester City full-back Walker, who he believes is physically more dominant than the Paris Saint-Germain forward. Walcott also claimed that playing in the Premier League is a completely different ball game than playing in Ligue 1. WHAT THEY SAID: ""I would love to see it. I really would. I feel like Mbappe would struggle against his [Walker‚Äôs] physicality, if I‚Äôm honest,'' The Southampton winger told talkSPORT. ''He plays in the French league, which is a different kettle of fish to the Premier League and Walker has so much experience in the Champions League. So it would be a great test. I think we all want to see it.'' However, he ultimately declined to pick a winner between the two, adding: ""I couldn‚Äôt tell you who would win that ‚Äì because Mbappe is a different beast, he‚Äôs on a different level at the moment.‚Äù THE BIGGER PICTURE: England can potentially face France in the quarter-finals if both nations successfully negotiate their respective challenges in the round of 16. Walker and Mbappe did go up against each other previously in the 2021-22 edition of the Champions League group stage when Manchester City locked horns with PSG. Both teams won their respective home matches with Mbappe scoring at the Etihad Stadium in a 2-1 defeat.  IN THREE PHOTOS:   WHAT NEXT FOR ENGLAND AND FRANCE?

Serbia vs Switzerland latest odds Serbia are the slight favourites to get the win in this match which would give them a chance of going through to the next round at odds of 13/8 (2.63) with bet365. Switzerland are the outsiders to pick up three points at odds of 9/5 (2.80) while the draw is priced at 9/4 (3.25).

Haris Seferovic is Switzerland's lowest-priced player to score the first goal of the game at 7/1 (8.00). Serbia vs Switzerland preview Serbia absolutely must win this match to have any chance of going through to the next round of the competition. They have just one point heading into this match, having been bested by Brazil and then surrendered a two-goal lead to draw 3-3 with Cameroon.

Switzerland, meanwhile, will progress with a draw as long as Cameroon do not beat Brazil in the other match. Serbia vs Switzerland tips and predictions This should be a tight and nervy affair so don't expect many goals.

Despite being second in FIFA's men's rankings, Belgium currently sit third in Group F of the 2022 World Cup behind Croatia and Morocco. Rifts in the camp have been reported amid off-field tension between Kevin De Bruyne and defender Jan Vertongen, with the Manchester City man claiming his side were ‚Äútoo old‚Äù to win the competition following a laboured 1-0 victory over Canada in their group opener. After defeat to Morocco in their second game, Vertonghen responded by saying: ''Where did it go wrong? We probably also attack badly because we are too old, that must be it now, surely?'' WHAT THEY SAID: Castagne has revealed Belgium players were called to sit down and discuss these tensions, which he refused to label a ""crisis meeting"".  ''I think it was very important for us to have that meeting, but it wasn‚Äôt a crisis meeting as you might have heard from some quarters,'' the Leicester full-back explained in a press conference. ''It was important to get some things off our chest and share our views, but it didn‚Äôt get out of hand. It was important to share how we felt and share our ideas on how we can improve.  ''I don‚Äôt think Kevin meant anything bad. We know that Italy won the Euros with Bonucci and Chiellini at the back, so age isn‚Äôt always a factor. I don‚Äôt think we should be focusing on one or two players who might not have been playing to the best of their ability. We‚Äôre all in it together. We all know we can play better. I don‚Äôt think age is a factor. I just think we played badly.'' THE BIGGER PICTURE: Castagne went on to admit that Belgium need to work on their togetherness in order to show their full potential on the pitch. ''Yes, I think we were united as a group, but perhaps not enough,"" he admitted. ""If you want to go far in the World Cup, you need to be united and you need to be able to fight together with your team-mates. Maybe we weren‚Äôt showing that enough. I think the meeting was helpful in that respect.'' IN THREE PHOTOS:  DID YOU KNOW?

The African side secured a 3-3 draw against Serbia to keep their hopes of progressing to the next round but must beat the group leaders to ensure they go through. Cameroon vs Brazil latest odds Cameroon are big underdogs to get the win in this match at odds of 13/2 (7.50) with bet365. Brazil are the favourites to pick up three points at odds of 2/5 (1.40) while the draw is priced at 15/4 (4.75). Cameroon vs Brazil first goal scorer odds Gabriel Jesus and Guilherme Pedro are the favourites to open the scoring at 15/4 (4.75) while compatriots Vinicius Junior and Richarlison are both available at 11/2 (6.50). Vincent Aboubakar was the hero for Cameroon when he came off the bench to score and assist goals to earn a 3-3 draw against Serbia and he is the African side's lowest-priced player to score the first goal of the game at 17/2 (9.50). Cameroon vs Brazil preview Cameroon are not in the best of form heading into this match. They were bested by Switzerland in their first group stage match before coming back from 3-1 down to earn a valuable point. They have not won any of their last six matches and will have to put an end to that run with a big win against the Selecao. Brazil have not lost since July 2021, going 17 games without defeat. Tite's men have won each of their last nine and will be looking to secure top spot in the group by beating Cameroon on Friday. Cameroon vs Brazil tips and predictions Cameroon have to come out to score against Brazil but the Selecao have considerable firepower, so backing over 2.5 goals at odds of 8/11 (1.73) looks an appealing bet.

WHAT THEY SAID: ""It was a misunderstanding,"" Messi explained. ""Those who know me know that I don't disrespect anyone. These are things that happen in the locker room after the game.

The equation remains simple for Morocco as they just need a draw to progress. However, if they are defeated things get complicated for Achraf Hakimi and co. In that case, Belgium must lose the other tie against Croatia in order for them to progress, or if Croatia loses, then they must do so by two more goals than Morocco.

212,Ronaldo missed Portugal training ahead of South Korea clash amid mounting injury concerns for Santos,Cristiano Ronaldo missed Portugal's training session on Wednesday ahead of their World Cup clash with South Korea.," WHAT HAPPENED? Ronaldo did not train with the group ahead of their final group-stage clash against South Korea in Group H on Friday. He instead worked individually, reportedly sticking to a tailor-made plan. The 37-year-old started both of Portugal's opening games against Ghana and Uruguay, and is not considered an injury doubt at this stage. THE BIGGER PICTURE: Portugal have already qualified for the round of 16 and so head coach Fernando Santos can afford the luxury to rest the forward. He has serious injury concerns elsewhere, however, with Nuno Mendes set to miss the rest of the World Cup with a thigh injury after he limped off in tears during Portugal's win over Uruguay. Danilo Pereira and Otavio were also absent from Portugal's latest training session as they are recovering from broken ribs and muscular problems respectively.

214,'Maradona would be super happy' - Messi reacts to breaking Argentina legend's World Cup record,Lionel Messi thinks Diego Maradona ''would be super happy'' to have seen him break an Argentina World Cup record previously held by the national icon.," WHAT HAPPENED? Despite Messi missing from the spot, Alexis Mac Allister and Julian Alvarez sealed a 2-0 victory against Poland on Wednesday that saw Argentina progress to the 2022 World Cup knockout stages as winners of Group C. When Messi took to the pitch he set another record as he became Argentina's most-capped player in the World Cup with 22 appearances, surpassing Maradona. The Paris Saint-Germain forward had a wonderful relationship with Maradona and he believes the late Argentine great would be ''super happy'' with his latest achievement. WHAT THEY SAID: ""I learned it recently, I didn't know it. It's a pleasure to be able to continue to achieve these kinds of records,'' Messi said when quizzed on the record after the Poland win. ''I think Diego would be super happy for me because he always showed me a lot of affection, he was always happy when things went well for me.'' THE BIGGER PICTURE: Messi missed the chance to increase his tally of World Cup goals to nine after fluffing his lines from the penalty spot, but he is still in the hunt for the 2022 edition's Golden Boot, having scored in both of Argentina's opening group games against Saudi Arabia and Mexico.

215,Carlos Valderrama: A Colombian icon - and not just for the hair,"The playmaker may have been renowned for his blonde mane but he was, first and foremost, a magnificent midfielder with a fantastic passing range."," Carlos Valderrama has always been easy to spot. That mop of blonde curly hair makes him one of the most recognisable figures in football. There was a time, though, before streaming, social media and widespread TV coverage, when it was difficult for football fanatics to watch the game's greatest players in action. Consequently, some top talent remained hidden for longer than it should have. Just like Valderrama.  The Colombian had been the best player at the 1997 Copa America and yet was relatively unknown in Europe. That all changed when he graced Wembley the following year.  Valderrama obviously stood out immediately because of his magnificent hair, but what really caught the eye was his wondrous range of passing. The English press were instantly smitten, and were full of praise for the quick thinking of Montpellier president Louis Nicollin, who had shrewdly signed Valderrama before any of Europe's biggest clubs.  ""We had heard there was a great midfielder playing in Colombia so we went down to take a look for ourselves,"" Nicollin told FIFA's official website. ""Then, we went to see him play for Colombia at Wembley in May 1988. We agreed terms with his club and Valderrama signed on right away.  ""He played like a dream in London and the following day all the English papers ran stories entitled 'Lucky Montpellier'."" Valderrama initially struggled to adapt to the more physical Ligue 1, and it didn't help that he wasn't the most industrious of midfielders. However, by the time the 1990 World Cup rolled around, he was playing the best football of his spell in Europe, having just inspired Montpellier to a Coupe de France triumph.  ""In the fast and furious European game he wasn‚Äôt always at his ease,"" former team-mate Laurent Blanc explained. ""He was a natural exponent of 'toque', keeping the ball moving.  ""But he was so gifted that we could give him the ball when we didn‚Äôt know what else to do with it knowing he wouldn‚Äôt lose it... and often he would do things that most of us only dream about!"" Valderrama underlined that fact at Italia '90, the tournament which made him a global icon.  He was never the most prolific of goalscorers but he helped Colombia kick off their campaign with a sweet strike in a 2-0 win over UAE in Bologna. Defeat against Yugoslavia put the team in an awkward position, needing at least a point against eventual winners West Germany in their final group fixture to progress. They looked doomed, then, when Pierre Littbarski broke the deadlock with just over two minutes of normal time remaining at San Siro. However, Valderrama intervened, and in sensational fashion, skipping past a couple of players before teeing up Freddy Rincon for a last-gasp equaliser that sent Colombia through to the last 16. Unfortunately, they would prove authors of their own downfall against Cameroon, with Rene Higuita making one of the most infamous errors in World Cup history, gifting Roger Milla the crucial opening goal in a 2-1 defeat in Naples after embarking upon an ill-advised dribble outside of his area in extra time. Back home, though, the fans were immensely proud of the national team's performances in what was only their second appearance at the finals ‚Äì and after a 28-year gap too. The reaction to the team's elimination from USA 94, though, was as shocking as it was tragic, with Andres Escobar shot dead shortly after returning home. The defender had scored the own goal which had effectively knocked Colombia out of a tournament many had tipped them to win, and was the reported motive for his murder.  Valderrama, just like the rest of his team-mates, was devastated by Escobar's death. ""It's still very difficult for me to talk about him,"" he told the St. Petersburg Times seven years later. ""It's very painful.  ""He was very close to me. We were very good friends, very good friends. That was my worst experience playing the sport."" Valderrama would go on to appear in a third World Cup, in 1998, but he was 37 at that stage and proved unable to prevent a weaker Colombia side from suffering another first-round exit. ""Naturally, I would have liked to have been world champion, but I don't regret the fact I wasn't,"" Valderrama later told FIFA.  ""You should only worry when you never get the chance to reach certain goals, and the fact is my team-mates and I had that chance, not just once but three times.  ""The World Cup is so tough that the best team we ever had, the one that went to USA 94, didn't even get past the group phase. We just didn't have it in us to win it.  ""Sport has been very good to me, though. I'll always remember those great moments we had with the national squad."" Football fans will always remember Valderrama, too, of course. And not just for the hair either. Which was the best World Cup winning team? Which was the best World Cup winning team?"
216,Honest to a fault: De Bruyne both a victim and cause of Belgium's World Cup breakdown,"Few fans disagreed with the Manchester City star when he claimed the Golden Generation's time had passed, but some of his team-mates aren't impressed"," Kevin De Bruyne was named Man of the Match in Belgium's highly fortuitous win over Canada. It was a farcical fan vote. And he was the first to admit it. ""I don't think I played a great game,"" a bemused De Bruyne told reporters. ""I don't know why I got the trophy."" And that's the thing about De Bruyne. He's honest. Maybe to a fault.  It's been evident for some time now that Belgium are a fading force. The feeling is that the 'Golden Generation' has lost its lustre. So, the last thing Roberto Martinez needed was for his best player to add his voice to the chorus of critics. In an interview with The Guardian last Saturday, De Bruyne was asked if Belgium could win the World Cup. His response? ""No chance, we're too old."" It got worse. ""I think our chance was 2018,"" he confessed. ""We have a good team, but it is ageing. We lost some key players. We have some good new players coming, but they are not at the level other players were in 2018. I see us more as outsiders."" In an era in which so few footballers say anything remotely interesting, De Bruyne should be commended for his frankness. However, his comments, which came just a day before Belgium's shock 2-0 loss to Morocco, clearly didn't go over well with his team-mates.  Speaking immediately after the game, veteran defender Jan Vertonghen sarcastically stated, ""I guess we attack badly because we are also too old up front..."" Martinez did his best to defuse the bomb that De Bruyne had dropped on the squad, arguing that sometimes comments are taken out of context. He even tried to argue that maybe it was a clever attempt to play down Belgium's chances. If it was a ""double bluff"", it backfired badly. Rather than lull Morocco into a false sense of security, it instead left Belgium looking like a squad in a state of disarray.  RTL even claimed that there had been an altercation between De Bruyne, Vertonghen and EdenHazard,  who had also labelled the Belgian backline ""not the fastest"". Romelu Lukaku supposedly had to break it up. Thibaut Courtois was quick to dismiss the veracity of the report, though, labelling it ""lies"". ""A situation was described [in that report] that doesn't exist,"" the goalkeeper insisted. ""As a group, we need to avoid that negativity. Everything was clarified. Everyone has openly expressed their opinion. It's good that we had a group conversation. We said what we thought to each other. We have to be honest with each other and fight for each other on the pitch."" Interestingly, Martinez doesn't believe that his players have been guilty of a lack of effort, instead pointing to a bizarre lack of confidence in possession. ""I thought we played [against Morocco] with the fear of losing,"" he said. ""Without the ball, we still work for each other, but when we have the ball, we don't stand out, we are not ourselves."" De Bruyne is the most glaring, and concerning, case in point.  He looks nothing like the player that has made the Premier League his playground over the past few years. He has no goals, no assists and just two successful dribbles to his name, while his pass accuracy is 71.43 percent.  There was disbelief in the stands during the Canada game when De Bruyne butchered a brilliant breakaway that he himself had sparked by failing to spot the supporting Youri Tielemans completely unmarked to his right, while he latter suffered the ignominy of being nutmegged by Stephen Eustaquio, which drew one of the loudest cheers of the night. De Bruyne fared even worse against Morocco, creating just one chance, losing the ball a whopping 28 times and having zero touches in the opposition area.  A colossal improvement is required if Belgium are to have any chance of beating Croatia in their final fixture to seal a place in the last 16.  Martinez has tried to alleviate the pressure on De Bruyne by pointing out that it‚Äôs not just the City star who is struggling in Qatar. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve not seen the best Belgium,‚Äù he argued. But we‚Äôre unlikely to see the best Belgium if we don‚Äôt see the best De Bruyne.  Furthermore, while the 31-year-old has more pressing concerns right now, it‚Äôs difficult not to ponder De Bruyne‚Äôs place in the pantheon of the game‚Äôs greatest players.  His status as a Premier League legend is beyond dispute. But he has yet to win a major European honour at club level, or a major trophy triumph with the most talented Belgium side of all time. For example, on Thursday, he will go up against Luka Modric. Exceptionally gifted as De Bruyne obviously is, would anyone really put him in the same bracket as a midfield mastermind that has been utterly integral to five Champions League triumphs at club level, as well as Croatia's run to the final of the 2018 World Cup? Even Vincent Kompany admitted before the tournament began that he feared his former team-mate might never claim the Ballon d‚ÄôOr award that he feels his talent so richly deserves. ""If I was Kevin ‚Äì or any player hoping to win it ‚Äì I would get in there now. He needs to win it before [Erling] Haaland and [Kylian] Mbappe start,"" the Burnley boss quite correctly pointed out. ""Because, for the next 15 years, it could be another Messi-Ronaldo scenario. The next couple of years is definitely the moment for Kevin to get involved and try to win it. ""Of course, it‚Äôs still a team effort to get to those closing stages, but De Bruyne is an important player for Belgium. He has been involved in the Ballon d‚ÄôOr vote for a few years now and he can win it. He is at his peak. I have no doubt Kevin will be a key player in this tournament."" De Bruyne has obviously yet to make his mark in Qatar, but there is still time. The Croatia clash will decide Belgium's fate, and arguably De Bruyne's World Cup legacy. Nothing less than a victory will suffice. The Golden Generation is never going to get another crack at this trophy and a first-round exit would tarnish both Belgium's reputation, and De Bruyne's. As he'd no doubt be the first to admit. Who will progress to the FIFA World Cup quarter-finals? Who will progress to the FIFA World Cup quarter-finals?"

218,'I lost ‚Ç¨100 bet with Messi! - Szczesny reveals penalty wager with Argentina captain & admits he'll 'probably get banned',Wojciech Szczesny has revealed that he lost a ‚Ç¨100 bet with Lionel Messi over the penalty incident during Argentina's win over Poland.," WHAT HAPPENED? Messi was bailed out after seeing his penalty saved by Szczesny as goals from Alexis Mac Allister and Julian Alvarez propelled Argentina to a 2-0 victory over Poland and seal the top spot in Group C. There was much controversy around the first-half penalty decision as it was deemed that Szczesny caught Messi in the face with his arm while grabbing an aerial ball. The keeper was so confident that referee Danny Makkelie would not point to the spot after checking VAR that he went ahead and placed a ‚Ç¨100 bet with Messi. However, Szczesny lost the bet as Makkelie gave the penalty, and he has jokingly admitted that he is now expecting to be punished. WHAT THEY SAID: ""We spoke before the penalty and I told would bet him ‚Ç¨100 that he [referee] wasn't going to give it,"" Szczesny told TV2.  ""So I've lost a bet against Messi. I don't know if that's allowed at the World Cup -- I'm probably going to get banned for it! But I don't care right now. I'm not going to pay him either -- he doesn't care about ‚Ç¨100 I think he has enough.'' THE BIGGER PICTURE: The Juventus keeper has been in fine form in this World Cup and is now up to two penalty saves, having also denied Saudi Arabia's Salem Al-Dawsari from 12 yards on matchday two. Ultimately, his save against Messi turned out to be crucial for Poland in the goal-difference battle with Mexico as they also progressed to the last 16. ""I was fortunate twice this competition,"" he told RAI Sport. ""It's a great moment in the career of a player, the World Cup is the maximum and this is special. There's a bit of work that goes into it, too, but in order to save a Messi penalty, you need some luck as well."" IN THREE PHOTOS:   WHAT NEXT FOR SZCZESNY?

Two outside contenders for GOAL50 are Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden, with both young midfielders sure to be popular picks among voters. The two sensational talents have the potential to be the future of England‚Äôs midfield‚Äîsome would argue they already ought to represent the present‚Äîbut will either of them get their hands on GOAL50 this year? This is the second time Foden has made the shortlist, having made the cut in 2021 on the back of magnificent year when he won the Young Player of the Season award and impressed at the European Championship. Since then, he's gone from strength to strength; he made 28 appearances as Manchester City again won the title last term, and is firmly on course to register his career best goal returns this term. Already this season, the 22-year-old has had a hand in 10 league goals‚Äîonly four fewer than in the whole of last term‚Äîand even netted a hat-trick in October‚Äôs 6-3 rout of Manchester United. Foden may be a generational talent, but he‚Äôs currently being eclipsed in the England team by Borussia Dortmund‚Äôs Bellingham, who may also pip the Manchester City man in GOAL50. Despite his slender years, the 19-year-old already looks accomplished at the highest levels of world football, having excelled in the Champions League and the Bundesliga. His form has prompted transfer rumours linking him with a move to Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United, although for now he‚Äôs focused on England‚Äôs World Cup bid‚Äîhaving already opened his international account against Iran in the Three Lions‚Äô opener. The wonderkid‚Äôs individual qualities‚Äîhis dynamism, technique, intelligence‚Äîset him apart as a future England great, while his maturity has already prompted talk that he could be a long-term captain of the national side.

With Argentina piling on the pressure in their final group game against Poland, they were awarded a penalty in controversial circumstances during the first half. VAR adjudged Szczesny to have fouled Messi by making contact when coming for a cross, but he saved the resulting spot-kick in tremendous fashion to deny the seven-time Ballon d'Or winner. WHAT HE SAID: Speaking after the match to TVP, the Juventus stopper explained his point of view on the incident: ""I immediately told the referee that I touched him (Messi) with my hand in the face, but I only hit him on the side of his face.¬†I told him there was contact but I don't think there is a penalty.¬†The referee decided otherwise and that's fine - I got to show off.

THE BIGGER PICTURE:Astoundingly, his fine effort to paw away Messi's spot kick means Szczesny has now already saved two penalties at the 2022 World Cup. And while it wasn't enough to inspire Poland to victory on the night, it proved crucial in ensuring they made it out of Group C and into the last 16. IN THREE PHOTOS: WHAT NEXT FOR POLAND?

Martino told reporters his tenure ended the second the final whistle blew on Wednesday. With his exit, a hire that at first inspired hope in 2019, finished in failure. WHY WAS MARTINO LET GO? The Argentine coach had become unpopular long before the World Cup, with losses to the United States in the Nations League and Gold Cup finals in the summer of 2021 turning his spell with El Tri toxic. Mexico decided not to make a change late in the qualifying cycle, but their continued trust in Martino didn't pan out, as the team's attack looked hopeless until it was too late in Qatar. AND WHAT'S MORE: Martino's unpopularity and his at times combative public persona led to reports that he would have left his post even if Mexico made a deep run in the tournament. All parties were ready to move on from a partnership that never worked. STORY IN TWO PHOTOS: WHAT'S NEXT FOR MEXICO? They must do a thorough analysis of what went wrong at the 2022 World Cup.

Mexico would have felt deep pain regardless of the elimination method, but this particular way of going out of the World Cup felt extra cruel. After squandering each and every chance given to them in the first two games of the group stage, El Tri finally threatened in the attack. They scored twice in the second half to inspire hope, but couldn't get the third that would have given them a tiebreaker advantage over Poland in Group C. A 2-1 win over Saudi Arabia that exhilarated their fans most of the way was ultimately irrelevant. Manager Gerardo ""Tata"" Martino's tenure is likely over, and it will be seen as a failure. Despite the fight back, despite the hope, the 2022 World Cup was a grand disappointment for El Tri, who expected to be around a lot longer than this.  This is their first group stage exit since 1978.

With France already having secured their place in the last 16 of the World Cup ahead of matchday three in Group D, head coach Deschamps used their game against Tunisia as a rare chance to rest and rotate his squad. They fell to a shock defeat, though, with Wahbi Khazri's goal the difference. WHAT HE SAID: Speaking to RMC after the match, Deschamps delivered his assessment: ""We had some difficulties through the choices that I made. It should help us in four days. Some players were at risk [of injury] and we had just played two high-intensity matches. It allowed the substitutes to see the difference [in quality] in a World Cup match."" He added: ""We‚Äôve reached the objective, we‚Äôre going to recover, now begins a second competition."" THE BIGGER PICTURE: A 1-0 win for Tunisia wasn't enough to secure them their place in the knockouts and instead sees them eliminated, due to Australia eking out a 1-0 victory of their own against Denmark elsewhere in the group. However, they can head home proud of their work, having beaten the defending champions. France, meanwhile, can be content with the fact they have rested key players ahead of the last 16.

Didier Deschamps made a handful of changes to his France starting lineup for their final group stage contest against Tunisia, but the heavily rotated side couldn't get the job done and fell to a 1-0 defeat. While it meant nothing with France already into the last 16, Liverpool's Konate wasn't happy with the result. WHAT HE SAID: Speaking to beIN Sports after the loss, he said: ""I hate losing. There won‚Äôt be any favours this weekend, it‚Äôll be a match and that‚Äôs it. I can‚Äôt say there were too many changes ‚Äì if we‚Äôre here today, we can‚Äôt go with that excuse. ""We weren‚Äôt at the level required, we were too wasteful. We need to concentrate on the next game, come together and forget this little error. Whether that‚Äôs against Mexico, Argentina, or whoever, it‚Äôs going to be a difficult match."" THE BIGGER PICTURE: Konate played the full 90 minutes in the defeat in what was his second start of the tournament. He lost his place after matchday one, and could face a battle to get back into the XI for the last-16 tie against Poland if Raphael Varane and Dayot Upamecano are both fit and available.

Argentina bounced back from a surprise loss against Saudi Arabia to comfortably dispatch Mexico and Poland 2-0, in the process topping the group. Poland barely made it through to the next round of games, with their excellent disciplinary record and solid defence giving them an edge over Mexico. Mexico left it too late for any hope of getting through to the knockout stages and will particularly rue the chances they didn't take in their final game. While Saudi Arabia couldn't build on their surprise opening day victory against favourites Argentina, they will leave the tournament with their heads held high, and memories which will be remembered for generations."

Argentina legend sets unwanted World Cup record with penalty miss against Poland,Lionel Messi missed another spot-kick for Argentina against Poland at World Cup 2022 on Wednesday.," WHAT HAPPENED? Messi won a penalty after he was floored in an aerial challenge with Poland stopper Szczesny. The Argentine legend stepped up to take the kick but saw it saved by the goalkeeper. Messi is now the first player in history to have two penalties saved in the World Cup. THE BIGGER PICTURE: Messi has missed two of his three penalty kicks at the World Cup (excluding penalty shootouts), equalling the most by a player since at least 1966 (Asamoah Gyan, two missed out of four). His last miss came against Iceland in the 2018 World Cup group stage. DID YOU KNOW?

Messi is now one of only two players to have missed two World Cup penalties since 1966, alongside former Ghana striker Asamoah Gyan. The Argentina captain also failed to convert from 12 yards four years ago in Russia as his country slumped to a 1-1 group stage draw against Iceland. WHAT NEXT FOR POLAND?

234,Explained: Why England cannot call up replacement for Arsenal defender White after World Cup squad exit,England defender Ben White has left the Three Lions' World Cup squad for personal reasons and is not expected to return., WHAT HAPPENED? England announced on Thursday that White has left the Three Lions' World Cup squad for personal reasons and is unlikely to return before the conclusion of the tournament. White's departure means manager Gareth Southgate is reduced to 25 players for the rest of the World Cup. #ThreeLions defender @ben6white has left England‚Äôs training base in Al Wakrah and returned home for personal reasons. WHY CAN'T ENGLAND REPLACE WHITE? All World Cup squads had to be submitted to FIFA by November 13. Changes were allowed before the tournament started but only if players had suffered an injury and illness that would rule them out for the duration of the World Cup. The cut-off date for any squad changes was 24 hours before each country's first game. England have obviously already played three games which means it's simply too late to call up a replacement for White. WHAT NEXT: England take on Senegal on Sunday in the last 16 of the World Cup.

After Argentina eventually made light work of Mexico in a 2-0 victory during the group stages of the World Cup, where Messi scored a fantastic opening goal, professional boxer Canelo accused him of disrespecting the Mexican flag and appeared to send threats his way. But, he's since apologised for his outburst. WHAT HE SAID: Canelo took to Twitter to issue the apology: ""These last few days I got carried away by the passion and love I feel for my country and made comments that were out of place for which I want to apologize to Messi and the people of Argentina. Every day we learn something new and this time it was my turn. ""I wish both teams much success in their matches today and here we will continue supporting Mexico until the end."" THE BIGGER PICTURE: After Messi had fired Argentina into the lead with a spectacular finish from distance, he was caught on camera in the dressing room at full-time seemingly kicking a Mexican shirt that had been swapped after the game. That enraged Canelo, who stated that Messi 'better pray to God that (he) didn‚Äôt find him'. IN TWO PHOTOS:  WHAT NEXT FOR MESSI? With Canelo now seemingly less keen to get Messi inside the ropes, the seven-time Ballon d'Or winners focus will undoubtedly be on firing Argentina to World Cup glory."

La Roja will win the group if they beat Japan and will then face Morocco, Croatia or Belgium in the last 16 before a potential clash with Brazil next. Luis Enrique has admitted he has already considered the ramifications and explained why playing for second place would be a risk. WHAT THEY SAID: ""It's a great question, because we've thought about it too,"" he said in a press conference. ""But imagine we want to finish second, we get to the 90th minute and it's 0-0 in the two games, and in the 95th minute with 15 seconds left, Japan and Costa Rica both score. You gambled, and you're out. Or imagine Germany are 5-0 up, we're looking for a draw, and Japan score and we're out. When you're convinced that you have a very good team and you want to play seven games [to get to the final], it isn't about finishing second. We want to finish first. If we play Brazil in the quarterfinals, great, we'll play Brazil. But we won't count our chickens before they've hatched.""

Pochettino has been a regular pundit in Qatar for the BBC so far at the 2022 World Cup. He's been out of work in a managerial capacity since he was dismissed by Paris Saint-Germain in July of this year. And having spent time covering international football as a pundit, he's now open to the idea of managing on the international stage. WHAT HE SAID: Speaking to Sky Sports, Pochettino explained: ""It wasn't under my consideration to go (into international management) but now, yes I am open. Why not? ""Yes, of course we are still young, full of energy, and day-by-day I like the adrenaline to train, to be involved,"" he added: ""Maybe the national team is a different job, but why not? If it's not the next job, then maybe in the future. It's not specific that all I want is Argentina. If another country, why not? For sure, that would be good also.""

France were trailing 1-0 to Tunisia at World Cup 2022 when Griezmann volleyed home in stoppage time and looked to have salvaged a point. However, the goal was ruled for offside following a VAR check.

VAR's decision to disallow Griezmann's goal did raise eyebrows and certainly did not impress the defending champions. The Frenchman was offside when the ball was originally played in but moved back into an onside position. Tunisia defender Montassar Talbi then headed the ball into the air, and Griezmann reacted smartly to volley the ball home. It appears the forward was deemed to be interfering with play despite the action occurring in the second phase. STORY IN TWO PHOTOS: WHAT NEXT?

Juventus have since denied these allegations, stating that any sporting sanction would be ""unfounded"" without accounting alterations. WHAT THEY SAID: ""The accounting treatment adopted in the contested financial statements falls within those allowed by the applicable accounting standards,"" a club statement read. ""The Public Prosecutor's allegations do not appear to be well-founded and, moreover, do not appear to be in line with the findings contained in the Consob resolution of 19 October 2022 in terms of either assumptions or conclusions.""

243,Saudi Arabia vs Mexico: Lineups & LIVE updates,All to play for as Saudi Arabia and Mexico face each other in a crucial encounter," Saudi Arabia surprised the world with an amazing comeback victory against tournament favourites Argentina, however, their happiness was short-lived as they succumbed to a defeat to Poland in the next game. Mexico were labelled by many as certified runners-up in Group C but haven't won a game in this World Cup. Both teams could still book a place in the knockout stages but will have to overcome many hurdles. If Saudi Arabia were to qualify it would be the second time in their history that they made it past the group stages. They last played beyond the first round of games in 1994 and would be hoping to make a deep run than they did back then. However, it won't be such an easy task. Mexico are unbeaten in all games against Mexico, having won thrice and drawn once. The fact that Saudi Arabia have only kept one cleansheet in their last eighteen World Cup games would make them more optimistic about securing all three points once again. However, their own record in the tournament isn't that great recently, with the Mexicans on a winless run of 4 matches. They can't take anything for granted. Saudi Arabia vs Mexico confirmed lineups Saudi Arabia XI (4-1-4-1): Al-Owais; Al-Tambakti, Al-Bulaihi, Al-Amri, Abdulhamid; Al-Hassan; Al-Dawsari, Kanno, Al-Ghanam, Al-Buraikan; Al-Shehri.

244,Poland vs Argentina : Lineups and LIVE updates,Argentina face Poland in an intriguing fixture as both teams look to secure a berth in the knockout stages ," Argentina and Poland cross swords in their last fixtures in Group-C as both teams would be looking for three points to qualify for the next round. A win would see either outfits go through while if they dro points they would be dependent on the result of the game between Mexico and Saudi Arabia to decide their fate. For Lionel Messi, it‚Äôs his one last chance to lift the biggest prize in football and a loss against Poland could send him home packing. The PSG forward was influential in guiding his international side to victory against Mexico and once again all eyes will be on the 35-year-old legend from Rosario. A win against Poland would see La Albiceleste march into the knockout stages while they could be in danger of going home if they drop points. Another factor for Lionel Scaloni‚Äôs men is the quality of opposition they would face if they win against Poland. If Argentina finish at the summit of Group-C, they would lock horns with Australia, but if they qualify from second position they would face France in the Round-of-16. Like Argentina, Poland will be dependent on their talismanic striker Robert Lewandowski to guide them through to the knockout phase. After missing a penalty in the opening fixture against Mexico, the Barcelona forward bagged his maiden World Cup goal to secure his team three points against Saudi Arabia. Once again, Lewandowski would be looking to find the back of the net and produce another upset and finish at the top of the group. The Eagles have looked solid in defense and are yet to concede a goal in this edition of the World Cup but keeping the likes of Messi, Di Maria, and Martinez at bay could prove challenging. Poland have conceded a goal in the 11 previous meetings against Argentina, and the Eagles will look to rectify their record while the team in blue and white would look to increase their goal scoring streak. Poland XI (4-4-1-1): Szczesny; Bereszynski, Glik, Kiwior, Cash; Frankowski, Bielik, Krychowiak, Zielinski; Swiderski; Lewandowski Argentina XI (4-3-3): Mart√≠nez; Molina, Romero, Otamendi, Acu√±a; De Paul, Enzo Fern√°ndez, Mac Allister; Messi, √Ålvarez, Di Mar√≠a  If Argentina win, they would finish at the pinnacle of the group and face Australia in the round of 16. If Lionel Scaloni's men finish second in the group they'll face France in the round of 16.  For Poland, a win or a draw would see them qualify for the next round. If they finish at the top of the group they'll face Australia and if they qualify on the second position they would lock horns with France.  Which was the best World Cup winning team?

245,FIFA considering group stage penalty shootouts at expanded World Cup in 2026,"FIFA is considering penalty shootouts to decide if teams should get a bonus point at the 2026 World Cup, should group games end in a draw."," WHAT HAPPENED? The Athletic reports that FIFA is considering a huge change to the rules for the 2026 World Cup. The change would see teams compete in a penalty shootout if they draw a group stage game, with a potential extra point up for grabs for the winners. THE BIGGER PICTURE: 2026 will be the first year the World Cup expands from a 32 team tournament to 48 teams, meaning a mammoth round will take place after the group stages. While not yet confirmed, 16 three-team groups look set to be established instead of the usual eight groups of four, with the top two from each group qualifying for a round of 32 knockout stage. AND WHAT'S MORE: In order to combat potential collusion that could come with staging penalty shootouts after games, FIFA is considering the idea of them taking place before games as a result. FIFA have had to combat this before, with the final matchday of World Cup group stages kicking off at exactly the same day and time since 1986, in order to avoid any foul play. IN TWO PHOTOS:  WHAT NEXT FOR THE WORLD CUP?

Chelsea are eager to sign the 18-year-old, whose style has been compared with Sergio Busquets. His advanced abilities for his age have prompted Vasco to demand a club-record fee for the player - the previous highest mark was ‚Ç¨18.5 million paid by Bayer Leverkusen for Paulinho in 2018. THE BIGGER PICTURE: It's understood that a clause in Santos' contract states that any English team can pay below his ‚Ç¨40 million release clause to secure his services, though the exact figure is not known. That clause is a boost to Chelsea and Newcastle as they try to negotiate a lower fee. AND WHAT'S MORE: Santos recently renewed his contract with Vasco, signing on until September 2027 with the Rio de Janeiro club. In 2022, the defensive midfielder made 42 appearances for Vasco, totalling 3,402 minutes on the pitch. STORY IN TWO PHOTOS: WHAT NEXT FOR ANDREY SANTOS?

248,Australia on the rise! Mathew Leckie's heroic goal sends Socceroos to the World Cup knockouts as Denmark dumped out,Australia dumped dark horses Denmark out of the World Cup with a 1-0 win in their final group game.," TELL ME MORE: Australia sealed second place in Group D at the World Cup 2022 by beating Denmark thanks to a second-half goal from Leckie. The Danes had the better of the first half but had few sights of goal and went in at the break without managing to find a breakthrough. Australia made a change at half-time, replacing Craig Goodwin with Keanu Baccus, and were much improved in the second 45 minutes.  As news filtered through the stadium that Tunisia had taken a shock lead against France in the group's other game, which meant Australia had to win, the Socceroos hit Denmark on a quick break, with Leckie scoring a fine goal to seal a vital three points. THE MVP: Australia's Leckie will take all the headlines after scoring a brilliant winner on the hour mark. The forward showed great pace and timed his run well to latch onto a through ball. Leckie then turned Joakim Maehle inside out before dispatching a low shot across goal and past the despairing dive of goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel. It's Leckie's 14th goal for the national team and one of his most important too, guaranteeing the Socceroos a place in the knockout stages. THE BIG LOSER: Denmark needed to beat Australia to progress but drew a blank in a flimsy display. The Danes needed their attackers to show their worth but there was very little quality on offer up front. Andreas Skov Olsen had one shot saved and that was about as good as it got from the striker. It was no surprise to see him replaced on 70 minutes after an utterly toothless outing. Skov Olsen wasn't the only Denmark player to disappoint by any means but this was a game where his team needed goals and he simply never looked like scoring. MATCH IN THREE PHOTOS:  FINAL GROUP TABLE:  0 WHAT NEXT? Australia will play the winners of Group C in the last 16.

249,"World Cup 2022 Group D: Fixtures, results, standings, squads & full details",Everything you need to know about the group with reigning champions France and Australia," Reigning champions France got drawn into Group D alongside Australia, Denmark and Tunisia at the 2022 World Cup. France were able to secure qualification to the next round within the first two games, becoming the first team to do so in the tournament. However, they almost lost the top spot with a shock loss to Tunisia. Australia surprised everyone with their performances against Denmark and Tunisia after their crushing defeat to France in the opening game, to finish as runners-up. Tunisia sadly failed to qualify for the Round of 16 despite beating France in their last match, however, they will go home with their heads held high. Denmarks were considered by many to be the surprise package of the tournament, having shown excellent form beforehand. However, they didn't replicate their earlier performances and leave the World Cup winless."

Henry, Giroud and Les Bleus' most lethal strikers",France national football team's goalscoring chart consists of some of the greatest players in football history," France are one of the most decorated national teams around and have produced some of the greatest footballers in history. Zinedine Zidane in his prime was just pure art. Michel Platini was very much a player in the same mould. Just Fontaine is an absolute World Cup legend. And then there were clinical attackers such as Jean-Pierre Papin, David Trezeguet and Thierry Henry. These days, the likes of Karim Benzema, Olivier Giroud, and Kylian Mbappe have taken over the mantle and spend a lot of their time on the pitch celebrating goals. But who is France's most lethal attacker ever? Let's take a look at the legends leading their all-time goalscoring charts!"
251,Martinez slams 'fake stories' amid reports of Belgium dressing room bust-up,"Roberto Martinez has rubbished rumours of a bust-up in the Belgium dressing room, labelling them ""fake stories""."," WHAT HAPPENED? Belgium's lacklustre start to the World Cup had led to reports of a dressing room bust up between Eden Hazard, Kevin De Bruyne and Jan Vertonghen. However, the players have since come out denying these rumours, and their words were echoed by their manager during his press conference previewing the Red Devils' must-win match against Croatia on Thursday. WHAT THEY SAID: ""There are media that like to jump on fake and negative stories instead of supporting the most talented team in the history of Belgian football,"" Mart√≠nez told reporters. ""I don't know where those stories come from or who brings them out. But that person scored an own goal for Belgium instead of supporting his country. We are here in Qatar to achieve our goal. Hopefully the real fans can still enjoy it."" THE BIGGER PICTURE: Belgium are facing their first group stage exit from the World Cup since 1998, as the nation's so-called 'Golden Generation' nears its end. Martinez's side sit third in Group F behind Croatia and Morocco, after falling to a shock 2-0 defeat to the latter on matchday two. IN THREE PHOTOS: DID YOU KNOW? Belgium have lost seven of their last 19 matches in all competitions (W9 D3), as many defeats as they‚Äôd suffered across their previous 74 games combined (W57 D10). WHAT NEXT FOR BELGIUM?

After it was announced on November 28 that the entire Juventus board had resigned, former club president Andrea Agnelli has spoken for the first time since the shocking news, in support of the Old Lady. WHAT HE SAID: Quoted by Gianluca Di Marzio, Agnelli spoke positively about Juve in a statement: ""Juventus is greater than any man who will ever be able to lead it¬†. (It was) a choice made in mutual agreement with John Elkann (CEO of the club's holding company Exor). ""I remain the leading fan and nothing changes for the team's programs and objectives: they are up to the situation, they can win anything.¬†I already said in 2019 that this is a system that needed to be regulated from within and that needs to be changed."" THE BIGGER PICTURE: Agnelli served as chairman for Juventus from 2010 until his 2022 departure, which came about as a result of an investigation into the club's concerning accounts, which began as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. IN TWO PHOTOS:  WHAT NEXT FOR JUVENTUS? It remains to be seen who will take over on the board of directors at Juve, as the club descends into chaos once again away from the pitch.

253,Brazil to bench almost everyone against Cameroon to avoid repeat of Neymar World Cup frustration,Tite will take few risks in Brazil's final World Cup group stage match on Friday as he tries to keep his squad fit ahead of the next round.," By Pedro Augusto Dias WHAT'S HAPPENING? Brazil will rest most, if not all, of their starting line-up against Cameroon, GOAL understands. With little to play for, Tite will take a safe approach knowing his players could be vulnerable in the final group stage outing. THE BIGGER PICTURE: The rotation may allow some younger players to gain valuable World Cup experience. Rodrygo and Gabriel Martinelli, for example, are in line to make their first starts at the tournament. AND WHAT'S MORE: Dani Alves, who made an improbable return to the national team just before the World Cup, is ready to be named to the starting XI in what would be another achievement in his storied career.

Stam was also critical of Jadon Sancho as he pointed towards United needing to have strength in depth up top if they are to compete at the highest level. The former centre-back praised Antony's goal contributions immediately after joining the club but feels the winger can do more. WHAT THEY SAID: ""Man Utd need a winger that can deliver a certain quality of football because Jadon Sancho isn‚Äôt delivering yet,"" Stam told¬†Football Betting. ""Marcus Rashford is doing very well, Antony has come in and has scored a couple of goals but I think he needs to step up because he‚Äôs not performing to the standard I know he can. ""To be consistent, Man Utd need forwards who are performing in almost every game and that‚Äôs why you need to have options because if someone isn‚Äôt performing, then you‚Äôre able to bring someone else in who can."" THE BIGGER PICTURE: Given their selection of underperforming forwards, United have been linked with PSV Eindhoven's Cody Gakpo since the summer window, with the 23-year-old taking the World Cup by storm and currently sitting joint-first in the tournament's goalscoring charts. However, Stam is on the fence about United signing his fellow countryman. ""Everyone is talking about Cody Gakpo, people are going to assume that Man Utd are going to go for him but I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs the situation,"" Stam continued. ""Gakpo would be a player that would fit into the Man Utd squad. There would be questions over whether he can deliver straight away because he‚Äôs from Holland and we have seen people struggle in the past."" IN THREE PHOTOS:  DID YOU KNOW? Antony became the 100th Brazilian to appear in the Premier League back in September, and is the youngest player from the nation to score on his debut in the competition (22y 192d). WHAT NEXT FOR ANTONY? Before focusing on his performances for United, Antony's attentions will be on international matters in Qatar.

255,"'Man Utd can eat you alive' - Harry Maguire 'feels more loved by England' and plays better for his country than club, says Neville",Gary Neville believes the loving environment around the England camp has helped Harry Maguire recover from his shaky Manchester United form.," WHAT HAPPENED? Neville, who made 603 appearances for Man Utd spanning 19 seasons, recognised the pressure associated with playing for one of England's greatest football clubs. The former full-back pointed towards the backing from Gareth Southgate and overall positive mood around camp as main factors in Maguire's improved form, after he has struggled for game time under new United boss Erik ten Hag. WHAT THEY SAID: ""I think he feels loved more by¬†England¬†maybe, I think he feels more at home,"" Neville explained to Sky Sports. ""Harry Maguire plays better for his country than his club. I think there are a few players who feel that way, Raheem Sterling. They have a good group, a manager who believes in them, who has selected them regularly.  ""Harry is a great centre-back and he has been brilliant in the last two tournaments, he has just had an awful time at United these last 12 months. United is a very unforgiving place, I know that from being there for 20 years, if you just do not get it right that place can just eat you alive - Harry is just getting that at this moment in time."" THE BIGGER PICTURE: Maguire has impressed in Qatar after starting all three of England's group games, partnered each time alongside John Stones as part of a back four. While this formula has been tried and tested in previous tournaments, Southgate raised a few eyebrows when he elected the pairing given Maguire's struggles at club level. So far, though, it has paid off with England conceding just two goals as they progressed as Group B winners. IN TWO PHOTOS: DID YOU KNOW? Maguire made as many touches in the opposition penalty area in the first half against Wales as Gareth Bale made all tournament (2). WHAT NEXT FOR MAGUIRE? Southgate is likely to call on Maguire once again when England take on Senegal in the round of 16 on Sunday, with a place in the quarter-finals up for grabs.

256,Brazil legend Pele re-admitted to hospital amid cancer battle as doctors confirm heart problem,"Brazilian football legend Pele was taken into hospital on Tuesday in Sao Paulo, in a visit that was not scheduled."," Pele was taken into the Albert Einstein hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil by his wife Marcia Aoki and a caregiver on Tuesday, according to ESPN Brazil. They state that he arrived unscheduled as a result of swelling all over his body, unlike previous, scheduled visits. The 82-year-old has been in and out of hospital with increasing regularity in recent years. He underwent surgery to remove a tumour on his colon in September 2021 and spent a period in intensive care, but has been undergoing chemotherapy in the time since. ESPN's report states that medical staff identified 'decompensated heart failure' when attempting to diagnose Pele's swelling, with the legend arriving 'restless and confused'. It is also said he now struggles to feed himself. Further tests are being carried out on November 30 to properly assess his condition, with no indication of a potential discharge. They hope to identify the organs compromised by the cancer in their testing, with his body not responding to chemotherapy. Pele's daughter, Kelly Nascimento, took to Instagram to provide an update on her father's condition on November 30. She captioned her post with: ""Hi my friends. Lots of alarm in the media today concerning my dad‚Äôs health. He is in the hospital regulating medication. Some of my siblings are visiting Brazil. There is now emergency or new dire prediction.

Mbappe has been named among the substitutes as Les Bleus conclude their World Cup group stage campaign at Education City Stadium on Wednesday. The forward was pictured with strapping around his ankle in a training session on Tuesday and it has been reported that he is dealing with an ongoing injury that is being managed carefully. THE BIGGER PICTURE: Mbappe's ankle issue is said to have originated while playing for Paris Saint-Germain, but it hasn't hampered him in Qatar so far, with the forward recording three goals in his first two appearances at the World Cup. Didier Deschamps will be expected to bring the 23-year-old straight back into his lineup when France play their first match of the knockout stages, with his side safely through already. AND WHAT'S MORE: Mbappe is not the only star name to drop to the bench for the Tunisia encounter, with Hugo Lloris, Olivier Giroud and Antoine Griezmann also being granted well-earned breaks. Raphael Varane is one of only two players to retain a place in Deschamps' first XI from the win over Denmark, with Arsenal's William Saliba once again missing out on a start.

However, for Tunisia, there is everything to play for. The African side could still end up qualifying, although it would require the Herculean task of beating the 2018 World Cup winners and hoping Denmark don't lose to Australia. The curse of previous World Cup winners getting knocked out from the tournament since 2010 was finally broken by France when they beat Denmark 2-1. With the top spot also essentially sealed, spectators may see a heavily rotated French side with important players (perhaps including Kylian Mbappe) being given a rest. Tunisia will be aiming to make history by making it past the group stage for the first time in their history. However, despite 27 shots in both games so far, they are yet to score in this edition of the World Cup. To beat a defensively astute France, the African side will have to be at their A-game.

262,Rashford compared to Beckham as Neville insists Man Utd 'could never sell' resurgent England forward,Gary Neville has drawn comparisions between Marcus Rashford and David Beckham while insisting Manchester United ''could never sell'' the England star.," WHAT HAPPENED? Neville, who played with Beckham when he came under intense media attention for his relationship with Victoria Beckham, believes Rashford has simplified his game after dealing with similar scrutiny and got back to doing what he does best. The former United defender also rubbished calls for the club to offload the forward some months ago, claiming that they ""could never sell"" such a talented player. WHAT THEY SAID:  ""There was that period in his life during lockdown where he achieved so much off the pitch,"" Neville told Sky Sports. ""It's hard. I played with [David] Beckham who had that off-the-field focus at times, whether it be in the earlier parts of his career when he started going out with Victoria [Beckham] and he had to cope with that off the pitch scrutiny all the time. Marcus had that for a couple of years whereby it brought pressure. ""Marcus Rashford has got back to what he does, he's simplified his life, he's still achieving great things off the pitch but in a more measured manner. There were people saying that Marcus Rashford needed to be sold by Manchester United. Manchester United could never sell Marcus Rashford. He's a massive talent. It's great to see him in an England shirt, and I think he's pushed himself into a position where he will start on Sunday."" THE BIGGER PICTURE: Rashford became the 2022 World Cup's joint-top scorer after his brace saw England demolish Wales 3-0 to finish top of Group B on Tuesday night. As Neville stated, the resurgent forward - whose first goal came in the form of a stunning free-kick - has played himself into contention for a starting spot on Sunday, as Gareth Southgate is left with a selection headache against AFCON champions Senegal in the round of 16. IN THREE PHOTOS:  DID YOU KNOW? Rashford became the first Manchester United player to score three goals at a major tournament for England since Bobby Charlton at the 1966 World Cup.

264,'Tough as nails' - USMNT hero Pulisic puts his body on the line to keep World Cup dream alive,"The Chelsea winger stepped up to the plate when his country needed him most, scoring a goal of immense bravery to clinch a 1-0 win over Iran."," How cruel is it that Christian Pulisic celebrated the biggest goal of his career from a hospital bed? As his teammates came together in the locker room to relish in what they'd accomplished, Pulisic underwent scans at a nearby hospital.  Music was surely blasting back in the bowels of Al Thumama Stadium, as evidenced by the absolutely colossal speaker wheeled around by DeAndre Yedlin postgame, but all Pulisic likely heard was the scans going off in some medical facility in Qatar. He did join in on the celebration through Facetime eventually, with teammates saying he was in good spirits after watching them win from afar.  But those teammates also admitted that they truly wished Pulisic had been there to celebrate the moment that he was so vital in creating. It wasn't supposed to be this way for American soccer's superstar. Or maybe it was. Fate has a funny way of working out, doesn't it? Pulisic was always destined to score this goal, the one that sent the USMNT to the knockout stage with a 1-0 win over Iran.  It just made so much sense that it was him, the player that has risen to levels higher than any American player, that led the U.S. to this point. Who else could step in a moment like that and, ultimately, add another chapter to his own legacy, one that now includes a World Cup game-winning goal that saw him exchange his own health for a USMNT win?  Talk about endearing yourself to fans. What more could you ask of a star player? Pulisic puts it away! üò§üé• ¬ª @FOXSoccer  pic.twitter.com/HPId4hsu4a Due to that exchange, though, Pulisic was never given that moment to celebrate what he'd accomplished. He never had that celebration to show off that tiger eye tattoo, to do the Griddy, to fist-pump in jubilation or to do whatever celebration he'd always dreamed of doing when he envisioned this in his head time after time. Instead, as his goal went into the back of the net, sending his teammates and the American fans in attendance into a rapture, he lay in the net wincing in pain. He'd bundled the ball over the line but sacrificed his body in the process. ""It just shows his bravery,"" said USMNT midfielder Kellyn Acosta. ""You just want it so bad. I'm glad that he was finally rewarded with a goal. I know he's super-hungry in front of the net. ""Knowing Christian, he's tough as nails."" Despite the ugliness of it all, it is a goal that will go down in USMNT history.  It may not have the beauty of Landon Donovan against Algeria or the overall importance of Paul Caligiuri's 'Shot Heard Around the World', but for a player of his stature to score on this stage, that automatically puts this finish in USMNT folklore. The goal, in a way, was quintessential Pulisic. He's often associated with his pace or flair but, more often than not, the goals he scores do come from pure effort. As Sergino Dest broke free down the right side, Pulisic saw his chance. He darted between two defenders and made a push for the backpost. Even with Alireza Beiranvand rushing out, Pulisic went all the way in. He got a touch to it and pushed it over the line, but collided with Beiranvand in the process. Afterward, he lay motionless for several minutes before eventually hobbling his way down the sideline. ""It goes like that in his career,"" said captain Tyler Adams. ""Backpost arriving, he's brilliant in that way with the time he is in the box to get in front of that ball. ""He'll do anything for his team in order for us to win. He's a huge player for us."" pic.twitter.com/F7WDxsz8su Adams isn't shortchanging it: Pulisic is huge. Now, though, the U.S. is facing the possibility of a knockout round without their star at 100 percent.  You have to admire the effort Pulisic put forward to finish out the half with a Willis Reed-like comeback but he surely didn't look like a player that was able to continue on in a World Cup game. U.S. Soccer confirmed after the match that Pulisic was at the hospital with an abdominal injury and that his status is still unknown.  He'll have until Saturday to rest up before the U.S. face the Netherlands and the man himself texted WestonMcKennie to tell him that ""You best believe I'll be ready.""  Let's hope so, because it remains to be seen who would, hypothetically, replace Pulisic if he can't play.  Could it be Brenden Aaronson, who came in for the Chelsea star in the second half to provide his endless energy? Or could it be Gio Reyna, who was conspicuously absent once again for the second of three World Cup games? His teammates, though, aren't worried about that yet. They have little doubt Pulisic will be back. ""We wish he was here to celebrate this one because obviously it was his goal,"" said defender Walker Zimmerman, who came off the bench to help the U.S. lock down the win.  ""It was a huge play that put us into the knockout stages and that's what we expect from our players, our big time players like him. ""We're all so happy for him and hopefully he rests up and comes back to contribute."" Added Adams: ""He‚Äôll hang in there. I know he‚Äôll do anything to play in the next game. So, we‚Äôll be counting on him.‚Äù the hotel was ROWDY when we got back üéâüéâüéâüéâ pic.twitter.com/xa5lBnDWO2 They've been counting on him for several years, since he was a 17-year-old teenager hoping to guide the U.S. to the 2018 World Cup.  Ultimately, that pursuit failed, with the lasting image of it all being Pulisic crying on the sidelines as the USMNT's World Cup dreams came to an end. Since that day, it had all been building to this moment, this goal. And Pulisic scored it, just like he always believed he would. It may not have looked like he'd imagined it. It surely didn't feel like he'd imagined it. In his head, it was all probably much sweeter. But there's more to come from Pulisic, who remains the USMNT's bonafide star. He has his first World Cup goal and, if he has anything to say about it, there will be more chances to celebrate further down the line. And maybe, the Soccer Gods will be kind enough to ensure that this is the last goal he ever celebrates from a hospital bed. Who will progress to the FIFA World Cup quarter-finals? Who will progress to the FIFA World Cup quarter-finals?"
265,Cuauhtemoc Blanco: The reluctant star whose trademark trick wowed the world at France 98,"The Cuauhtemina may be a semi-comical piece of skill but it made its creator famous, even appearing in the FIFA video game series."," Mexico certainly made an impression on the 1998 World Cup.  In their spectacular Aztec-design strips, El Tri pulled off three dramatic comebacks in the group stage, while Luis Hernandez scored four times before the curse of ‚ÄòEl quinto partido‚Äô kicked in. However, by that stage, Cuauhtemoc Blanco had left an indelible mark on the tournament ‚Äì with an outrageous, audacious and semi-comical 'trick' that became his trademark. Having been drafted into the squad following Mexico‚Äôs disappointing round-of-16 exit at USA 94, the then-25-year-old Blanco was a little-known name on the global stage, having just returned to Club America from a loan spell with Necaxa.  However, he made himself famous in El Tri‚Äôs opening game at France 98, introducing the tournament to the 'Cuauhtemina' ‚Äì or the ‚ÄòBlanco Bounce‚Äô as it became known in certain parts of the English-speaking world. You may not know it by either name, but you are almost certain to have attempted or fallen victim to this ridiculous manoeuvre on the playground or in the park if you have ever so much as kicked a football. To set the scene, Mexico had levelled against South Korea early in the second half at Lyon‚Äôs old Stade Gerland following an early red card for goalscorer Ha Seok-Ju ‚Äì who was dismissed literally one minute after sticking a free-kick into the back of Jorge Campos‚Äô net. El Tri were growing in confidence and smelled blood, epitomised by Blanco throwing out his Cuauhtemina not once, but twice. With two defenders converging on him on the left flank, he waited until they were close enough before trapping the ball between his ankles and leaping between his bemused opponents and into space.  A lot of you remembered. So go on, pat yourselves on the back üëçüóìÔ∏è #WorldCup 1998, @miseleccionmxEN v @theKFA Sit back and enjoy the 'Cuauhtemi√±a' üçø pic.twitter.com/tFPsrP7p0U The name Cuauhtemoc translates as ‚Äòdescending eagle‚Äô, which is apt when you see footage of Blanco touching down, arms spread wide, prey (the ball) locked between his custom Mexican flag-design Reebok boots. Mexico would go on to beat South Korea 3-1, with Blanco providing the assist for Hernandez‚Äôs sealing strike, and they would be forced to come from behind twice more in their remaining group stage games to qualify for the knockout stage, with Blanco making his most telling contribution from a footballing perspective against Belgium.  Having gone two goals and one man down, El Tri produced a stirring seven-minute comeback to level after their opponents were reduced to 10 men themselves.  It was Blanco who netted the all-important leveller, hurling himself at a deep cross and expertly squeezing the ball inside the back post on the volley with the outside of his left boot. Another creditable comeback draw from two goals down would follow against the Netherlands, courtesy of an injury-time Hernandez equaliser in spite of a last-minute red card.  Consequently, El Tri edged through to the last 16 alongside the Dutch on goal difference. Having held his signature move in reserve since the opening game, Blanco decided the time was right once again against Germany in Montpellier, taking to the air and soaring between Christian Worns and Jorg Heinrich.  However, while he did provide a silky assist for another Hernandez goal to open the scoring, Blanco and his Cuautemina were unable to carry Mexico to a famous victory, as strikes from Jurgen Klinsmann and Oliver Bierhoff saw El Tri finally end up on the wrong side of a come-from-behind win. There was disappointment that Mexico had failed to make the most of what was a talented group of players mainly in their prime, but Blanco had, at least, written himself into World Cup folklore. He became one of the founding members of an exclusive club of esoteric, mercurial footballers who are synonymous with one outrageous piece of skill ‚Äì like Ricardo Quaresma and the 'Trivela', Kerlon and his ‚ÄòSeal dribble‚Äô, Rodrigo Taddei and his dazzling 'Aurelio', and Jay-Jay Okocha with his eponymous turn. Indeed, the Cuautemina has even been immortalised in the FIFA video game series (hold L1 and press R3, if you‚Äôre wondering). It's worth remembering, though, that Blanco achieved great things in a Mexico shirt. His performance in the 1999 Confederations Cup final win over Brazil is the stuff of legend in his homeland.  Indeed, he is widely regarded as one of the best footballers Mexico has ever produced, renowned for his brutish forward play and deceptively quick feet, while he played the game with a take-no-prisoners physicality and had a fiery temper (he was once banned for eye-gouging an opponent) ‚Äì all of which led to him becoming a star in both Liga MX and MLS. However, while he never shied away from the limelight on the field, often courting controversy by taunting opponents with over-the-top goal celebrations, he never truly aligned with the notion of celebrity, believing himself to be the archetypal everyman.  In an interview in 2004, he said: ‚ÄúI don't feel famous. I am the same as a waiter, a [street] sweeper, like any person who works in the maintenance of the club.  ""There are people who have fame and money, but they don't have feelings, which is the most important thing.‚Äù Asked if he felt he was gifted, he added: ‚ÄúI don't know... I would like there to be three or four like me, I wouldn't envy them.‚Äù Never one to shy away from a war of words, though, Blanco would perhaps unsurprisingly move into politics following the end of his playing career as he sought to represent those normal people with whom he felt such a connection.  Initially joining the left-wing Social Democratic Party, he would switch allegiances to the right-wing Social Encounter Party in 2017, having battled allegations of corruption and even murder while municipal president of the city of Cuernavaca in the state of Morelos.  Blanco was elected governor of Morelos in 2018 by a landslide and remains in the post ‚Äì still making a huge impression on the Mexican landscape to this day, but as a politician now, rather than the eagle that descended upon France in 1998 and wowed the world with his signature skill.

We're going to have to be ready for that game, but I think right now we enjoy this moment, have some downtime to relax and recover now, [and then] mentally focus.

THE BIGGER PICTURE: Adams took over the USMNT captaincy from Chelsea's Christian Pulisic in November - who suffered a pelvic contusion scoring the winner against Iran - and oversaw an unbeaten run in Group B with five points from three games. They face a Netherlands side who have come under fire for their ""boring"" brand of football, but who nevertheless qualified as Group A winners with a near-perfect seven points and boast the tournament's joint-top scorer in Cody Gakpo.

""I would like to have some certainty by February.

While Pulisic collided with Iran's keeper Alireza Beiranvand and suffered a pelvic contusion, Sargent ended up standing on a ball that had spun away from him, leading to the 22-year-old overextending his¬†knee. It was later confirmed that it was the forward flex of his ankle that forced him to be substituted in the 77th minute of the match.

So yeah, we're gonna do everything we can. Hopefully, this one is not too bad.""  THE BIGGER PICTURE: The full extent of the injury will be known when Sargent goes for a scan on Wednesday.

"," WHAT HAPPENED? The Netherlands sealed a knockout berth as group winners after beating Qatar 2-0 on matchday three. Cody Gakpo was once again their star man as he opened the scoring before Frenkie de Jong doubled their lead in the second half. However, Van Gaal got into a verbal altercation with the Dutch media after the game as a reporter questioned his team's style of play and said watching them is like ""grinding teeth"".  WHAT THEY SAID: ""I think you have a different perspective to me, why don‚Äôt you write down it‚Äôs terribly boring. If you think it‚Äôs boring why don‚Äôt you go home,'' The Oranje boss replied to the journalist in question. ""Well that‚Äôs disappointing I think but I don‚Äôt agree with you, I think everyone would be rather proud we‚Äôre progressing to the next round and I think people know why you‚Äôre asking these questions. I don‚Äôt think things are as bad as you say.'' THE BIGGER PICTURE: Although the Dutch have struggled to produce the footballing sparks that are expected of them in the World Cup, they have managed to get the job done and remain unbeaten in the tournament.

According to Spanish publication Marca, Ronaldo has been offered a two-year contract by Al-Nassr, who are able to sign the 37-year-old on a free transfer following his departure from Manchester United. THE BIGGER PICTURE Marca reports that Ronaldo has also attracted interest from MLS, but he is very conscious of picking up the most lucrative wage possible if calling time on his illustrious career in Europe. Al-Nassr are willing to pay the Portugal forward a grand total of ‚Ç¨400 million if he agrees on a deal to play for the Saudi Arabian club until 2025. AND WHAT'S MORE Ronaldo's second spell at Old Trafford came to an acrimonious end earlier this month as United announced the termination of his contract by mutual consent. The decision was made following the five-time Ballon d'Or winner's controversial interview with Piers Morgan, during which he accused the club of betraying him and admitted to having no respect for head coach Erik ten Hag. STORY IN TWO PHOTOS  DID YOU KNOW? Should Ronaldo indeed end up joining Al-Nassr, he will link up with another former Premier League star in David Ospina, who played in goal for Arsenal between 2014 and 2019.  WHAT NEXT FOR RONALDO?

281,"'Best believe I'll be ready!' - Injured Pulisic has made USMNT vow ahead of Netherlands World Cup last 16 tie, reveals McKennie",Christian Pulisic has vowed to be get fit for the USMNT's World Cup round of 16 tie against the Netherlands after getting injured against Iran.," WHAT HAPPENED? The USMNT got the better of Iran in their final group-stage match on Tuesday, with Pulisic scoring the only goal of the match in the 38th minute. However, in the process of scoring the goal after connecting to Sergino Dest's cross, he collided with Iran's keeper Alireza Beiranvand. The 24-year-old gingerly got to his feet after receiving treatment, but he had to be substituted at half-time and was taken to hospital for checks. Pulisic's teammate Weston McKennie has since confirmed that he is doing well and should be fit to take to the pitch on Saturday against the Netherlands.  WHAT THEY SAID:  ""I sent him a text and checked on him, and he said, 'Best believe I'll be ready on Saturday,"" said McKennie.  ""Obviously we're very thankful that he threw his body there. At the end it was a heart-drop sinking moment, but we got it done and we're excited to still be here.'' THE BIGGER PICTURE: US Soccer stated that Pulisic was taken to the hospital and has been diagnosed with a pelvic contusion that was termed ""day to day"" in terms of recovery time. USMNT head coach Gregg Berhalter was elated with the commitment that the forward showed and also revealed that the team had a video call with the player to get an update on his condition. ""We got to speak to him and he's in good spirits,"" Berhalter told reporters. ""That's what he does, that's the special quality he has and as soon as a goal is wide he goes in with intensity. He crashes the box and makes it really difficult for defenders with his change of pace. It's a wonderful thing when one of your best players is also one of the most hard-working. He's certainly that. I can't say enough positive things about Christian."" IN THREE PHOTOS:    WHAT NEXT FOR PULISIC?

282,What do Mexico need to qualify for last 16 of 2022 World Cup?,Tata Martino's men are winless in the 2022 World Cup and they have it all to do against Saudi Arabia on matchday three. ," Mexico have a mountain to climb against Saudi Arabia after dropping points in their first two games of the World Cup.  They were left frustrated by Poland in their campaign opener as it ended in a stalemate, while in their second match against Lionel Messi's Argentina, they failed to make any impact in the final third whatsoever as the Albiceleste registered a comfortable 2-0 victory.  Mexico enter their third Group C match, against Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, needing to win and get help elsewhere to advance to the knockout stage. Here is everything you need to know about how the El Tri can qualify. What to Mexico need to do to reach last 16?  Mexico will take to the pitch on Wednesday evening at the Lusiail Stadium with the aim to get nothing less than three points. Only a win over the Asian giants will help them to remain in contention for a berth in the round of 16.  However, even if they win, their fortunes are not in their hands. They must also hope that Poland beat Argentina. If Argentina beat or draw with Poland, then El Tri must have a superior goal difference, which seems a tall order.  Currently, they have a goal difference of -2, whereas, both Poland and Argentina have a healthy goal difference of +2 and +1 respectively.  This means that they will have to win big against Saudi Arabia.  History is not on their side as they've now failed to score in four consecutive World Cup outings dating back to 2018.  Who could Mexico face in the last 16?  Mexico can qualify from Group C only as runners-up. So they will be facing the winners from Group D if they progress.  France are leading Group D with a perfect win record. They are set to face Tunisia next in their final group outing and should bag the three points if they play to potential.  If Les Bleus are held to a draw they will still progress as group winners. However, if they lose heavily and Australia beat Denmark by a big margin then France will go through as runners-up.  In that case, Mexico will face Australia in the round of 16.  The game would take place at the Al Thumama Stadium on December 4. It has not yet been decided who will air Mexico's last-16 tie, although the game will be shown on either ITV or BBC. Both channels also offer online streaming access, via BBC iPlayer and ITVX.

284,Cristian Volpato: Roma's Australian wonderkid who turned down a World Cup call-up,The 19-year-old has impressed for Jose Mourinho's side but opted against committing himself to the Socceroos when invited to Qatar 2022.," Unfancied heading into the World Cup, Australia's players stand on the edge of potential glory in Qatar, knowing that they are 90 minutes away from footballing immortality in a country that is still learning to love the beautiful game. A draw against Denmark may well be enough for the Socceroos to reach the knockout stages of the competition for just the second time, while a win will guarantee progression for Graham Arnold's team. Theirs is a squad of few star names, with perhaps Celtic midfielder Aaron Mooy ‚Äì who had stints in the Premier League with Huddersfield Town and Brighton ‚Äì the most recognisable to European fans. If things had gone differently, though, then Australia could have had one of Serie A's rising stars amongst their number.  Roma attacking midfielder Cristian Volpato has already made an impact on the first team at Stadio Olimpico, and Arnold was keen for him to join up with the Socceroos squad in Qatar. The 19-year-old turned them down, though, instead choosing to wait on making a decision over his international football. Given his talent, it is a call that is unlikely to define his career. But what makes him so special, and why were Australia so keen to have him at the World Cup?  Let NXGN explain..."
285,From Lautaro to De Paul: Argentina's disappearing Copa America heroes have left Messi polishing 'turds' in Qatar,"The captain kickstarted his country's campaign against Mexico, but it was staggering to see so many of the Albiceleste's Copa winners underwhelm"," With one swing of his left foot, Lionel Messi announced Argentina's belated arrival at the 2022 World Cup. And the noise that welcomed them back onto the game's grandest stage was deafening. Ear plugs were rendered useless by an explosion of Argentine joy at the Lusail Iconic Stadium. There was relief there too, though, and plenty of it. ""A weight off our shoulders,"" Messi admitted after their 2-0 win over Mexico on Saturday night. The days leading up to the game had been ""very long"", the skipper said, with the players bitterly ""angry"" with themselves for having slipped to a shock 2-1 loss to Saudi Arabia in their Group C opener. Goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez even admitted having spoken with a psychologist. ""I suffered a lot,"" he confessed. ""They took two shots at me and I conceded both. I have 45 million Argentines behind me and I should have given more."" The onus was, of course, on Messi to give more. He had opened the scoring against Saudi Arabia, from the penalty spot, but he too had faded after a bright first half, meaning he was facing a humiliating first-round exit at his final World Cup. His goal, then, represented a release, for him and his team-mates. And the coaches too. Pablo Aimar was reduced to tears by Messi's 64th-minute strike. That's how much it meant to them. And perfectly illustrated just how much pressure they're all under.  Messi, of course, carries most of the burden. And usually makes light of it. As Angel Di Maria said, his assist for the equaliser wasn't a particularly good pass. ""I threw him a turd but he always finds solutions to everything,"" the veteran winger enthused. ""He scored a tremendous goal and I just don‚Äôt have words for him any more.  ""I have had the chance to play with the best player in the world at club level, and for 14 years with the national team, and for me Leo is everything."" Messi cannot do it all, though. Not at a World Cup. It's impossible for one man to carry an entire team. People like to perpetrate the myth that Maradona won the 1986 edition all on his own, but that does a gross disservice to the likes of Jorge Valdano, Jorge Burruchaga and Jose Luis Brown ‚Äì men who stepped up to the mark when their country needed them most. If Lionel Scaloni's Argentina are to have any hope of emulating that side, it is imperative that Messi's supporting cast play their parts. It is worrying, then, that so many of the protagonists from last year's Copa America triumph have gone missing in Qatar.  The injury-enforced absence of Giovani Lo Celso was obviously a massive blow, and one that Scaloni could have done little about. However, he now has a major issue in midfield, given Leandro Paredes and Rodrigo De Paul, who started alongside Lo Celso in the 1-0 win over Brazil in Rio in July of last year, have both performed abysmally thus far.  Indeed, Paredes was dropped after his horror show against the Saudis, while De Paul failed dismally to justify his retention in the starting line-up against Mexico, giving the ball away 16 times in total. Thus far, the midfield duo have looked exactly what they are: two men who have arrived in Qatar undercooked after little football at club level this season. Cristian Romero is also seriously lacking minutes because of his injury issues, looking a shadow of the player who made such an impact at the Copa, and it was no surprise to see him quickly lose his starting spot to Lisandro Martinez. Lautaro Martinez has no excuse, though, for his lack of match sharpness. The 25-year-old has led the Inter attack for the majority of the first half of the 2022-23 Serie A campaign, but the concern is that one of the streakiest strikers in world football is in one of his infamously fallow periods.  There is, therefore, a clamour for Julian Alvarez to start up front in the must-min match against Poland, even though he is only 22 and effectively Erling Haaland's understudy at Manchester City. Scaloni has no other centre-forward available to him if he does decide to bench Lautaro, so there will be a temptation to stick with a player who contributed three goals to their victorious Copa campaign.  But it would not be a surprise to see Argentina take to the field without five of the players who started against Brazil in Rio: Lo Celso (injured), Paredes, De Paul, Romero and Lautaro. That is a sign of just how much this previously rock-solid Argentina side has been destabilised over the past few days.  A team on a 36-game undefeated run now knows that a second loss in the space of a week would send them out of a tournament that many pundits tipped them to win.  Poland represent a formidable foe, too. Wojciech Szczesny is looking unbeatable in goal, Piotr Zielinski has brought his Napoli form with him to Qatar, while Robert Lewandowski's tournament is up and running after his own sluggish start. More Messi magic may well be required. But there‚Äôs only so many times they can ask him to turn a ‚Äòturd‚Äô into something truly tremendous. Which was the best World Cup winning team?
