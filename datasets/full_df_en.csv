" Pele has been undergoing chemotherapy for bowel cancer since last September, and there were dire local media reports on his condition earlier onSaturday. However, the 82-year-old has now offered an update on his condition and thanked fans for the many messages of support he has received. ""My friends, I want to keep everyone calm and positive,"" Pele wrote on Instagram. ""I'm strong, with a lot of hope and I follow my treatment as usual. I want to thank the entire medical and nursing team for all the care I have received. ""I have a lot of faith in God and every message of love I receive from you all over the world keeps me full of energy. And watch Brazil in the World Cup too! ""Thank you so much for everything."" The Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein also issued a statement on Saturday regarding Pele. The hospital stated the Brazilian was ""stable, with a general improvement in his health status.""

" Lionel Messi has his first goal in the knockout stage of a World Cup, and boy was it a crucial one, with the Argentina captain breaking the deadlock out of nowhere in a hard-fought 2-1 win over Australia. Up until that point, the Socceroos had frustrated the life out of the Argentina fans, who once again took over nearly an entire stadium here in Qatar. They had come to see Lionel Messi mark the 1000th game of his incredible career with another masterclass, and they eventually got one, but, for the first 35 minutes, pretty much nothing happened. The No.10 was quickly surrounded by yellow shirts every time he received the ball and he struggled to impose himself on the proceedings. Nobody else in an Argentine shirt looked like making a breakthrough either.  If history has taught us anything, though, it's that Messi only needs a split second to score, and that's precisely what he did, reacting first to what looked more like a loose touch than a lay-off from Nicolas Otamendi.  That lethal left foot took care of the rest, with the Paris Saint-Germain star simply passing the ball into the bottom corner of the Australia net. Julian Alvarez then took advantage of a shocking mistake from Mathew Ryan to make it 2-0 and although Australia set up a tense finale courtesy of a speculative shot from Craig Goodwin that deflected in off Enzo Fernandez, Argentina held on thanks to a terrific late block from Lisandro Martinez, and a fine stop from namesake Emiliano. Below, GOAL breaks down the winners, losers and ratings from another memorable night for Messi's Argentina...",football
" The Netherlands are back at the World Cup after missing the 2018 edition and head coach Louis van Gaal will be confident they can spring a surprise and go far. They have made it to three World Cup finals in the past, but have yet to lift the coveted trophy as they have fallen at the final hurdle each time. Could this be the time they finally leave that pain behind and go all the way? They navigated their way past hosts Qatar, Ecuador and Senegal in the group stages, finishing top of Group A with seven points from three games. Van Gaal's side then beat the USMNT 3-1 in the last 16 to book their place in the quarter-finals. Here are the 26 players Van Gaal has picked for the tournament proper and how they could line up in the next round against Argentina.",football
" Lionel Messi is in perhaps his final World Cup, and so far, so good for the Argentina icon. His latest performance - a goalscoring effort in the last 16 against Australia - was one of his most important, though there are certainly many standout efforts over the years to choose from. There may be more to come, too, as Messi will lead Argentina into a quarter-final clash with the Netherlands. GOAL takes a look at some of his best-ever international performances...

" Australia had a chance to equalise against Argentina in the last minute of stoppage time of their last 16 clash.

" It's World Cup time! After a four-year wait, the best national teams in the world are battling it out again to determine who lifts the coveted trophy after the final on December 18. At Russia 2018, France claimed World Cup glory, with Didier Deschamps - who also won the tournament as a player - seeing his side defeat Croatia 4-2 in the final. Can the French retain their crown or is it finally Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo's turn to add a World Cup to their enviable list of honours? How about a Neymar-inspired Brazil to come out on top? Eternal favourites Germany and Spain will surely fancy their chances too.

" Brazil are still sweating on Neymar's fitness ahead of their knockout tie against South Korea after the Paris Saint-Germain forward sustained an ankle injury in his team's opening win against Serbia. Neymar has missed Brazil's last two matches but seems to be in positive mood ahead of the last 16 match. THE BIGGER PICTURE: Brazil will obviously want to have their talisman back as soon as possible. Tite does not lack for quality forwards in his star-studded squad, although he has seen Gabriel Jesus ruled out of the tournament with a knee problem. WHAT NEXT FOR NEYMAR?

" Speaking after the Oranje's 3-1 victory over the USMNT on Saturday, Van Dijk claimed that the Spanish club are on a much higher level than their Manchester rivals. The centre-back was full of praise for the young forward, arguing that a move to Madrid could be the logical ""next step"" in his career. WHAT THEY SAID: ‚ÄúAre Manchester United and Real Madrid on the same level? No disrespect, not at all,"" Van Dijk said. ""I definitely think he has that next step in him. I definitely feel like it could happen, whether that is in the winter or the summer or next year, time will tell. He is a great boy who works hard, very talented and definitely there is more in him.

" Australia goalkeeper Ryan was guilty of a mistake as took a heavy touch from a back pass which allowed Alvarez to nick possession and fire the ball into an empty net to make it 2-0 to Argentina.

" Cristiano Ronaldo versus Lionel Messi - who is the GOAT? It is the biggest conundrum in football since the 'Diego Maradona or Pele?' debate. The question of who is better between the Portuguese phenomenon and the empyrean Argentine has dominated the minds of football fans everywhere for the past decade and will persist into the future. Club and national loyalties can cloud judgement on the matter, while personalities also play a part in how good a player is perceived to be, and most people know who they'd pick. So who really is the greatest of all time? Never mind who you prefer, GOAL has taken a look at how the pair actually shape up head-to-head so you can be fully armed with facts in the eternal argument.  On this page Cristiano Ronaldo vs Lionel Messi: Club goals Ronaldo has scored more club goals than Messi, but only just and it should be noted that the Manchester United star benefits from having played two more seasons than his Argentine nemesis thus far. Each of them has remarkably netted over 690 club goals in their career so far, with the five seasons between 2009-10 and 2014-15 proving particularly golden as they pushed each other to greater heights. While Ronaldo currently has more goals overall, Messi has the edge in the scoring department, with a higher season average (37.9 to 35), having hit a high of 73 goals in 2011-12, though his average dropped after a disappointing maiden campaign at PSG in 2021-22. Ronaldo's highest season return was 61, which he achieved in 2014-15, and he surpassed the 50-goal mark every season for six years between 2010-11 and 2015-16. Interestingly, while Ronaldo's seasonal totals have declined somewhat in recent years - he failed to break the 30-goal mark in 2018-19 during his first season at Juventus - Messi's have remained consistent, though the Argentine's rate slowed after joining PSG. Cristiano Ronaldo vs Lionel Messi: Club assists (Opta) When it comes to assists, Messi is much superior to Ronaldo and that contrast has become increasingly stark as their respective roles evolve. The fact that Messi creates so many goals as well as scoring them is a major consideration when deciding which player is the GOAT and, while Ronaldo chips in with his fair share, the difference in this particular realm is stark. Cristiano Ronaldo vs Lionel Messi: Champions League stats *As of Champions League games played in 2022-23. Ronaldo is the all-time leading goalscorer in the Champions League, having shone in the competition with Manchester United and Real Madrid in particular. However, Messi isn't far behind and actually has a fractionally better goal-per-game ratio, so there is a good chance that he could overtake the Man United man if he continues to sparkle in the competition . Ronaldo also holds the record for most overall Champions League appearances, having overtaken Iker Casillas. Cristiano Ronaldo vs Lionel Messi: World Cup stats When it comes to World Cups, Ronaldo and Messi are considered underperformers due to the simple fact that neither has won the competition. Portugal star Ronaldo has scored more goals at the tournament and in fewer appearances, but Messi can claim to have gone furthest, having reached the final with Argentina in 2014. The PSG attacker won the Golden Ball during that tournament, despite missing out on the ultimate glory at the hands of Germany. The furthest Ronaldo reached with Portugal was the Selecao's run to the semi-final in 2006, when they were beaten by France before losing the third-place play-off against Germany. Cristiano Ronaldo vs Lionel Messi: International stats Ronaldo and Messi have similar records at international level, though Ronaldo boasts greater numbers, partly because his senior Portugal career kicked off two years before Messi's with Argentina. Ronaldo equalled Ali Daei's record of 109 international goals at Euro 2020 and then surpassed it with two goals against the Republic of Ireland, becoming the top international goalscorer of all time. Messi is a long way behind Ronaldo in that respect, though he is by some distance Argentina's top goalscorer of all time, surpassing the great Gabriel Batistuta some years ago. Cristiano Ronaldo vs Lionel Messi: Titles    *National Cups refers to the main national cup competition in a country only, e.g. the FA Cup, Copa del Rey etc. Messi and Ronaldo have very similar trophy hauls, but Messi edges things when it comes to league titles, having won La Liga 10 times with Barcelona. Ronaldo has seven league titles, but unlike Messi, he can claim to have won the league in three different countries (England, Spain and Italy) - something that increases his claim to the GOAT crown in the eyes of some. Ronaldo has an edge over Messi in the Champions League, his love affair with the competition earning him the moniker 'Mr Champions League'. The Manchester United star has also enjoyed notable success on the international stage with Portugal, winning the European Championship and the UEFA Nations League. Messi, on the other hand, has endured considerable heartache with Argentina, with four unsuccessful Copa America campaigns, three of which saw them lose in the final. He finally got his hands on the Copa in 2021, before going to win the 2022 Finalissima. While neither has won the World Cup, Messi has an Olympic gold medal. Cristiano Ronaldo vs Lionel Messi: Individual awards The individual battle between Ronaldo and Messi has been the defining feature of modern football for the past decade and more. Messi went ahead of Ronaldo in the Ballon d'Or stakes when he won his sixth in 2019 and cemented his superior status in that field with his seventh in 2021. Ronaldo does boast more of FIFA's new 'The Best' awards and has been crowned UEFA Player of the Year on more occasions, but Messi has won more league Player of the Year accolades. Of course, it must be said that Ronaldo has won the Player of the Year award in England, Spain and Italy. Messi has got his hands on the European Golden Shoe a record six times, which is two more than Ronaldo, and is marginally ahead of his rival overall, but the fact that both have been on the FIFPro World XI 14 times is an illustration of how closely fought the battle has been.

" Lionel Messi is not just one of the best creators of chances around in the game, but he is lethal in front of goal himself as well. The Paris Saint-Germain star is Argentina's all-time leading goal scorer by some distance and holds numerous other goalscoring records, both at club and international level. For the national team, it all started with a tumultuous debut appearance against Hungary in 2005, with Messi receiving a red card barely a minute after coming off the bench. That was merely a blip on his journey to greatness, though, and the forward got his first Argentina goal at senior level in a 3-2 friendly loss against Croatia the following year. That turned out to be start of an impressive goalscoring run and Messi has since been able to celebrate goals more or less wherever he went. Just how many strikes does the Barcelona legend have to his name, though, and in which competitions did he find the net the most often?

" Lionel Messi is undoubtedly one of the best players the world has ever seen. There. We said it. But how about Cristiano Ronaldo? Yes, of course, also one of the greatest ever. Just look at their stunning all-time career stats. It's something else. Let's stick to Messi for now, though.  The current PSG star is not just one of the best players overall, but also one of the most lethal goal scorers. He is Barcelona's all-time top goal scorer for a reason. He is LaLiga's all-time top goalscorer for a reason. He is the record holder for goals scored in a single calendar year for a reason.

" Pulisic was back in the starting XI after injury for the USMNT against the Netherlands at World Cup 2022 on Saturday but couldn't prevent his team being knocked out of the tournament.

" While choosing the best player from a minimum of 22 is a decision often shrouded in debate, this winter's World Cup has seen a few arguable selections across the first round of group matches. Behind this change could be the tournament's new selection process for the award, which includes the heavy involvement of fans online.  Budweiser's Player of the Match trophy is awarded through a public vote on the FIFA+ website. The window opens between the 60th and 88th minute of each game, in which fans from across the globe can cast their thoughts for each match's star player. Users are limited to one vote per match, and must be of legal age to register in order to be able to participate. There is no way of policing whether fans are watching the games in question, though, meaning several awards were handed to players that were arguably less deserving.

" The Arsenal shot-stopper, who started every one of the USMNT's matches in Qatar and impressed throughout, highlighted the importance of going far in the tournament in order to increase soccer's exposure as it continues to grow in the United States.  WHAT THEY SAID: ""It is always important for us to do well because we know it gets the most press and coverage on TV in the U.S.,"" Turner told the Evening Standard after the match. ""Good performances in the World Cup grows the game.""  THE BIGGER PICTURE: While Saturday's result will be bitterly disappointing for the USMNT, Turner's comments echo those of his manager. Gregg Berhalter pointed towards the growth of his side on the world stage, as his young team gained valuable experience in Qatar which it will undoubtedly take to the next tournament in 2026, when the U.S. will be one of three host countries alongside Canada and Mexico. IN THREE PHOTOS:  DID YOU KNOW? The USMNT's game against the Netherlands was the first in which Turner conceded a goal from open play in the tournament.

" Argentina legend Messi will make his 1000th career appearance in Qatar for La Albiceleste against Australia in the last 16 of the competition on Saturday.

Van Gaal also shared his thoughts on his team's overall performance, adding: ""Our plan was to create space and that all worked out. One goal was more beautiful than the other.

WHAT THEY SAID: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have a Memphis Depay right now, who‚Äôs scoring in the Champions League,"" Berhalter proclaimed, despite Memphis never scoring a Champions League goal since joining Barcelona. ‚Äú[The Netherlands] were clinical in their [scoring] opportunities in the first half.

After overcoming a poor outing against Saudi Arabia, Argentina managed to win their remaining fixtures against Mexico and Poland to secure a round of 16 ticket. La Albiceleste would now like to continue their winning streak and defeat Australia to continue their quest for glory.  Once again all eyes would be on Lionel Messi to guide Argentina to victory with a scintillating performance. Another positive for Argentina would be that they have defeated Australia in their previous 4 meetings, a streak Lionel Scaloni would want his squad to continue. Considering the gulf in quality between the two outfits, it would be a competitive fixture for the Australian team.

" Goals from Memphis Depay, Daley Blind and Denzel Dumfries cancelled out an unusual strike from Haji Wright as the USMNT was eliminated from the last 16 of the tournament.

WHAT THEY SAID: ""We made some progress [in proving the United States can compete on world stage],"" Berhalter said to FOX. ""When people look at our team, they see a clear identity, players who fight for each other on the field. It's really special to see, you don't often get a bond like that."" THE BIGGER PICTURE: While the USMNT failed to reach what would have been its first quarter-final since 2002, Berhalter's quotes reflect a more rounded focus on the national team's long-term plan. Many of his players were featuring in their first ever World Cup in Qatar, meaning Saturday's exit will provide them with valuable experience moving forward to the 2026 finals hosted by the U.S. alongside Canada and Mexico.

" The USMNT's 2022 World Cup run ended under the bright lights of Khalifa International Stadium on Saturday.  After spending the last two weeks showing how far it had come in developing an international identity, the team was shown by a true superpower what elite, ruthless soccer looks like.  It's clear that while the USMNT has grown, there is yet more growing up left to do before 2026. The tears flowed as the full-time whistle blew, with frustration at individual mistakes and missed opportunities in front of goal in the 3-1 defeat. A feeling that the Netherlands was better, but the USMNT also hurt itself. ""If you give them three, four chances, they're going to put them away,"" said a disappointed Tyler Adams to FOX afterwards. This was a lesson in what it takes to be among the best in the world. Top teams are clinical, cruel, vicious. And, throughout this tournament, the U.S. showed time and time again that it wasn't quite there. Finally, the players paid for it. The Netherlands, meanwhile, cemented its status as World Cup contenders. The Oranje warped the USMNT's defense, ruining a group stage's worth of hard work in 90 minutes. The U.S. made seismic error after seismic error, effectively engineering its own undoing as a quick two-goal deficit proved too much to overturn. It'll be a bitter pill to swallow. The USMNT has gotten better, that's for sure. The group stage was great evidence of that. But American soccer is still nowhere near the very best.",football
" France face Poland at the Al-Thumama Stadium on Sunday in the last 16 tie of the 2022 World Cup. Both teams ended their group stage campaigns with defeat, although Les Bleus topped Group D while Poland finished second in Group C. Didier Deschamps' men were the first to book their spot in the last-16 but couldn't keep a perfect record as Tunisia got the better of a side without the likes of Kylian Mbappe, Ousmane Dembele and Antoine Griezmann who were all rested. Despite Wojciech Szczesny keeping out Lionel Messi's penalty in the 2-0 defeat to Argentina in their final group game, Poland's goal difference of 0 against that of Mexico (-1) is what saw Robert Lewandowski and Co. into the knockouts.

" The Three Lions and Manchester City star joked that even he wasn't sure where he wanted to play, before deciding that just behind the striker would be his preference. Foden did highlight that he is more than capable of playing out wide, his current England position, but feels he would be better utilised through the middle. WHAT THEY SAID: ""I don't even know! Everywhere,"" Foden joked. ""I feel like I'm a 10, whether it's now or in the future, behind the striker, getting on the ball and trying to make things happen. I'm playing more out wide and I can do that job as well. At the same time I do like playing wide because you score more goals and get in the box a lot more."" THE BIGGER PICTURE: Having failed to start in England's first two group matches, Southgate chose to put Foden in his starting line-up against Wales amid clamour for his involvement, and the City starlet soon repaid his manager's faith. Foden got his first ever World Cup goal to score England's second in a 3-0 win, and his constant offensive threat has given the Three Lions boss a difficult decision ahead of their last-16 tie against Senegal on Sunday. IN THREE PHOTOS: DID YOU KNOW? Foden helped England finish top of their World Cup group for the first time since 2006, when they were eventually eliminated by Portugal at the quarter-final stage.

" Leeds came within a whisker of signing Gakpo in the summer but saw a proposed move to Elland Road break down. Marsch admits it will now be difficult to land the Netherlands forward as his price tag has risen after some impressive performances for club and country. WHAT THEY SAID: ""It's difficult for us at Leeds because I think Gakpo's gotten out of our price range,"" he told Men in Blazers. ""I mean, we were so close to securing a transfer for him in the summer, it was so close, and now obviously it's disappointing. Our sport director was in Holland meeting with the family, they had agreed on terms, on everything, was talking with PSV. I mean, we were 99.9% [agreed]."" THE BIGGER PICTURE: Gakpo will surely be in demand after his eye-catching showings and is wanted by a host of clubs. Man Utd continued to be linked with a move for the Dutchman and Gakpo has said he expected to join the Red Devils in the summer. PSV Eindhoven director Marcel Brands has ruled out a January move but hinted that Gakpo may depart next summer. IN THREE PHOTOS:  DID YOU KNOW?

" WHAT'S HAPPENING? Senegal's assistant manager Regis Bogaert and third-choice goalkeeper Alfred Gomis took the meeting with journalists on Saturday in Cisse's place. Bogaert revealed that the manager had also been absent from Friday's training session having been ill for several days. WHAT THEY SAID: ""He has been sick for a couple of days now,"" Bogaert revealed. ""He let us take charge of training yesterday, obviously with his instructions to the players. Hopefully tomorrow he will be able to come and be on the bench with the players but we are sure at 10pm he will be there with the team."" THE BIGGER PICTURE: Despite Bogaert's assurances, Cisse's absence from training as well as from his side's press conference just a day before their match against England will be of some concern to Senegal. Cisse helped mastermind a second-placed finish in Group A with a 2-1 win against Ecuador on matchday three, and will be sorely missed if he is unable to step out in the dugout on Sunday.

They might have made it to three World Cup finals, but they have also ended up losing every single one of them. Euro 1988 was that one time that things all went their way, with the legendary Marco van Basten scoring one of the best goals ever in the final. The former AC Milan star is by no means the only attacking superstar Oranje have had, though. Johan Cruyff is arguably one of the greatest players ever, Dennis Bergkamp is an absolute Premier League legend and the likes of Ruud van Nistelrooy and Robin van Persie are among the greatest goalscorers to have graced a pitch, too.

" It's official, then: Belgium's 'Golden Generation' is over. Their miserable group-stage exit at the 2022 World Cup confirmed as much, as an ageing squad of star names struggled to stamp any kind of authority on the tournament before heading home after three games. Manager Roberto Martinez has already confirmed his departure, and this will surely be the last go around for a number of the team's stalwarts. Euro 2024 is only 18 months away, so some players might feel they have one more international tournament in them, but it feels highly unlikely that veterans like Toby Alderweireld, Axel Witsel and Jan Vertonghen will make it all the way to the 2026 World Cup. Injuries probably mean that Eden Hazard has also played his last World Cup, while Kevin De Bruyne and Romelu Lukaku will have to weigh up whether they can face another cycle while playing for what is likely to be a much-inferior team than they are used to.

WHAT HE SAID: Pochettino hit out at critics who said his underwhelming performance in Europe was the reason for his dismissal, suggesting if that was the case, then perhaps other managers such as Guardiola should have received the same fate.

" Five-time World Cup champions Brazil are the most successful team in the history of the competition, but 2002 was the last time the Selecao got their hands on the coveted trophy. There were quarter-final exits in 2006, 2010 and 2018, while they had to settle for fourth spot in 2014 after a tournament to forget. Now it's up to the likes of Neymar, Vinicius Junior and more to end the Selecao's drought and finally bring home the trophy once more. They went past Serbia and Switzerland but lost to Cameroon in their final group game. However, they have successfully booked their berth in the round of 16 as group winners. A spirited South Korea now awaits in the next round and Tite's side have to be at their very best if they want to reach the quarter-finals.

WHAT THEY SAID: Brazil's team doctor, Rodrigo Lasmar, offered a tentative update for Neymar and teammate Alex Sandro, saying: ""We think we have time on our hands and there is a possibility. Let‚Äôs wait what their transition will be - they have still not started to practice with the ball and it‚Äôs something they will do tomorrow. It will be important to see how they respond to this new style, so depending on that, we will make a call."" THE BIGGER PICTURE: While Brazil secured passage to the knockout stages relatively easily, they would rather see Neymar return as soon as possible.

" Maguire has had a far from ideal start to the season. He was dropped by Erik ten Hag after a string of poor performances and has seen his play time limited for Manchester United, but he has turned that form on its head for England. He has looked imperious at the back for the Three Lions and his defensive partner Stones has been full of praise for him ahead of England's round of 16 clash with Senegal. WHAT HE SAID: When asked about Maguire in a press conference, Stones said: ‚ÄúRight from the first game, the best response is what he‚Äôs been doing. All three games he‚Äôs played in have been terrific and it‚Äôs about us finding that partnership again. I think we have done (that) in these three games. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a great credit to him.

" Reigning world champions France are looking to keep their hopes of retaining their title alive when they come up against Poland on Sunday. Les Bleus must bounce back from their surprise defeat to Tunisia to get the better of Czes≈Çaw Michniewicz's team, who made it to this round by getting four points from matches against Mexico and Saudi Arabia. France vs Poland latest odds France are unsurprisingly the favourites to get the win in this match in 90 minutes and progress to the next round at odds of 2/7 (1.29) with bet365. Poland are big outsiders to win at odds of 12/1 (13.00) while the draw is priced at 4/1 (5.00). France vs Poland first goal scorer odds Kylian Mbappe already has three goals to his name in the World Cup and is the obvious favourite to open the scoring at 3/1 (4.00) while compatriot Olivier Giroud is available at 4/1 (5.00). Robert Lewandowski is Poland's lowest-priced player to score the first goal of the game at 11/1 (12.00) while Arkadiusz Milik is 18/1 (19.00). France vs Poland preview France head into this game off the back of their shock defeat to Tunisia. But coach Didier Deschamps will not be too worried about that defeat given he made nine changes to the starting XI from the team that beat Denmark in their previous match. Kylian Mbappe, Antoine Griezmann and Olivier Giroud can expect to return to the team for the last 16 clash. Poland put in a reserved performance as they were beaten 2-0 by Argentina, failing to get a shot on target for the whole match. They will have to put in a much better display this time around as France will be quick to punish any wastefulness from Poland. France vs Poland tips and predictions France are expected to get the job done against Poland but there is little value in backing them. They look good value to win and keep a clean sheet, though, so backing France to win and against both teams scoring at odds of 5/6 (1.83) may be worth a bet instead.

Boulaye Dia is Senegal's lowest-priced player to break the deadlock in the African team's favour at 12/1 (13.00) while Famara Diedhiou and Ismaila Sarr are both set at 14/1 (15.00). England vs Senegal preview Senegal were rocked before the tournament as it was announced Sadio Mane would not play a part in the World Cup. But matters were made worse in their last group stage match as Idrissa Gueye picked up a suspension for the last 16 tie because he picked up two yellow cards.

" Just like pretty much everyone else, Jose Peseiro was surprised to learn that Enzo Fernandez is only 21 years of age. ""Either that's a lie,"" Nigeria's Portuguese coach told A Bola, ""or he's a genius."" It's definitely not the former, but it could well be the latter.  The World Cup never fails to propel previously little-known players to superstardom, but the Fernandez fairy-tale is something truly special. We're talking about a kid that posted a heartfelt plea to Lionel Messi to reverse his decision to quit playing for Argentina after the 2016 Copa America. ""Do what you want, Lionel, but please think about staying. Stay and have fun,"" he wrote on Facebook. ""In a world of ridiculous pressures, they manage to get the most noble thing out of the game, the fun. ""Seeing you play with the light blue and white is the greatest pride in the world. Play for fun, because when you're having fun, you have no idea how much fun we have. Thank you and forgive us."" Last Saturday night, Fernandez took a pass from his idol just inside the Mexico penalty area and bent the ball into the top corner to seal a vital 2-0 victory. ""I know Enzo very well, here from the national team and I also played against him in the Champions League,"" Messi told reporters afterwards. ""He deserves it, because he‚Äôs a spectacular kid and a very important player for us."" There's no doubt about that now. Fernandez may have only made his international debut in September, but he is now a certain starter in Saturday's last-16 showdown with Australia.  The River Plate academy product was excellent in Wednesday's 2-0 win over Poland, creating the second goal for Julian Alvarez with a clever scooped pass between a couple of defenders.  Fernandez hasn't just impressed with his offensive threat, though, he's also been excellent from a defensive perspective, underlining precisely why he's long been regarded by those in the know as one of the most promising box-to-box midfielders in world football. Indeed, during a hugely beneficial loan spell at Defensa y Justicia in 2020-21, club president Diego Lemme told the youngster that he was a future Real Madrid player. And that prediction could well come true.  Madrid are just one of a plethora of elite European clubs vying for Fernandez's signature. He only joined Benfica from River during the summer, of course, but the Portuguese side stand to make a colossal profit on the ‚Ç¨10 million (¬£8m/$10m) they paid for the San Martin native, with Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Chelsea also reportedly interested. The battle for his services is wholly unsurprising. Fernandez's talent is as impressive as his temperament, as despite all of the hype, he's as grounded as they come.  He was first named on the River bench in January 2019, but didn't actually make it onto the pitch until March of the following year. Not long after, he was sent out on loan, but he wasn't upset; on the contrary, he embraced the move.  ""When Marcelo [Gallardo, River coach] told me about Defensa, I took it well because it was a chance to show myself, get some games and compete against first-rate players,"" Fernandez told Ole. ""I was lucky to be coached by two great trainers like Hernan Crespo and Sebastian Beccacece, share a squad with huge players and even better people, and pick up two titles (the Copa Sudamericana and the Recopa Sudamericana) which will go down in history. ""I have always been the same player, but my time at Defensa helped me grow so much, not just as a player but as a person. ""I grew up a lot and that prepared me to go back to River and adapt in a different way to the team's rhythm."" Meanwhile, when the Madrid rumours first surfaced after his return to the Monumental, Fernandez told TyC Sports that he would remain ""calm"" and ""humble"" and continue to keep a ""low profile"" off the pitch. He has a young daughter with his childhood sweetheart and is renowned for a level of maturity that belies his tender age. As reported by MARCA, he's also impressed everyone at Benfica with his work-rate and dedication to his craft. He brought his personal physio with him from Buenos Aires and immediately installed a gym in his Lisbon home. His hard work and professionalism paid off, with Lionel Scaloni handing Fernandez his first Argentina cap as a substitute in the 3-0 friendly win over Honduras just two months ago. It was just reward for a blistering start to the season in which he had scored both home and away against FC Midtjylland in the qualifying rounds of the Champions League. Fernandez would go on to feature in five of Benfica's six group games as the Eagles sensationally pipped Paris Saint-Germain to top spot in their group, knocking out Juventus in the process.  It's still staggering, though, that Fernandez has emerged as such a pivotal player for Argentina at the World Cup. Wednesday's start against Poland was his first for his country but it was wholly justified. Argentina's Copa America triumph last year owed much to the influence of Giovani Lo Celso, who was ruled out of the World Cup through injury. And with Leandro Paredes and Rodrigo De Paul both struggling for form and fitness, Scaloni needed someone to step up, and that's exactly what Fernandez has done. He is proving an excellent link between Argentina's midfield and attack.  Messi is having fun again for a variety of reasons. But the kid who so touchingly urged him to continue playing six years ago is undoubtedly one of them. Which was the best World Cup winning team? Which was the best World Cup winning team?",football

" The first World Cup to ever take place in Africa was marked with adidas‚Äô release of the Jabulani match ball, which included eight spherically moulded panels designed to drastically improve aerodynamics. The Zulu word for Jabulani means ‚Äúrejoice‚Äù, but it's fair to say it wasn't warmly received. Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon described the ball as ‚Äúabsolutely inadequate‚Äù, while Brazil striker Luis Fabiano labelled it ""very weird"". ""All of a sudden, it changes trajectory on you,"" the latter explained. ""I think it‚Äôs supernatural, it‚Äôs very bad.‚Äù  However, one man embraced the Jabulani's physics-defying potential right from the off. ‚ÄúThree months before the 2010 World Cup, Diego Forlan asked adidas to send him a Jabulani ball,"" the striker's former Uruguay team-mate Sebastian Abreu told El Observador in 2020. ""At Atletico Madrid, he stayed after the training, practising moves with the ball in motion and free-kicks.‚Äù That extra practice paid off in Uruguay‚Äôs second group game, against tournament hosts South Africa, with Forlan scoring twice in a 3-0 win. His first goal silenced the vuvuzelas inside a rocking Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium, as he picked the ball up some 30 yards from goal before letting fly. The ball swooped and swerved in multiple directions on its way to the back of the net and left the South African keeper rooted to the spot.  It would prove a sign of things to come. Uruguay's quarter-final clash with Ghana is obviously best remembered for Luis Suarez's infamous handball, which denied The Black Stars what would have been an extra-time winner. However, it was also a game in which Forlan's due diligence would be once again rewarded in spectacular fashion. With the Celeste 1-0 down 10 minutes into the second half, the former Manchester United forward stepped up to take a free-kick on the far left of the box. Forlan lashed the ball home with unerring confidence to change the momentum of a game that ended in a shootout victory for Uruguay. That controversial victory earned the Celeste a heavyweight semi-final tie against a free-scoring Netherlands outfit led by Robin van Persie. Giovanni van Bronckhorst produced a stunning, Forlan-esque strike from distance to put the Dutch in front. However, the man himself refused to be overshadowed and underlined his status as the most consistent ball-striker at the tournament with another sensational effort to draw Uruguay level just before the break, finding the top corner with his weaker left foot. Oscar Tabarez‚Äôs side ended up losing 3-2, though, and were beaten by the same scoreline in their third-place play-off with Germany. However, Forlan continued to showcase his mastery of the match ball, scoring another screamer to seal the Golden Boot, after cleverly volleying the ball into the ground and past Germany No.1 Oliver Kahn. The striker‚Äôs fifth goal at the finals ended up being voted the best of the tournament, controversially pipping Van Bronckhorst‚Äôs semi-final piledriver to the title, and capped one of the most remarkable individual World Cup showings of all time. Forlan was also presented with the Golden Ball as the tournament‚Äôs best player, ahead of Wesley Sneijder and David Villa, as a just reward for the way he was able to tame the Jabulani like no other. Conspiracy theories abounded. Some claimed that Forlan had inside information on how to get the most out of the Jabulani, while others suggested the ball was actually under remote control. The Uruguay legend set the record straight during an interview with Between the Lines in April, backing up Abreu's story. ""There are no mysteries here. A lot of practice, a lot of training and again a lot of practice,"" he said. ""I got lucky and [the Jabulani] behaved very well back then. And we got along great!""

" The champions' curse was only meant to last for one World Cup! Germany thought they were done with embarrassment on the global stage after their groups-stage exit in 2018, but the football gods had other plans for Hansi Flick's team in Qatar. Germany's loss to Japan in their opening game ultimately cost them this time around, and the 2014 winners have now backed that up by falling at the first hurdle in each of the next two tournaments. Factor in their last-16 exit at Euro 2020, and it has not been a stellar run for German football, meaning there is immense pressure on Flick to restore one of the sport's most decorated international teams to their former glories, and quickly.

But what about the next World Cup? The likes of Manuel Neuer and Thomas Muller have surely graced the tournament for the final time, so how will the team look when the United States, Canada and Mexico host in three-and-a-half years' time?

" It‚Äôs fair to say that Cody Gakpo has lived up to his billing so far at the 2022 World Cup. With three goals in three games ‚Äì one with his head, one with his left-foot and one with his right ‚Äì the Netherlands forward has been one of the stars of the group stage, and he will be looking to continue his scoring form as the Oranje take on the USA in the last 16 on Saturday. Gakpo arrived into the tournament with a reputation as one of the up-and-coming stars of European football and the 23-year-old‚Äôs performances for PSV Eindhoven this season, where he has been directly involved in 29 goals in all competitions, have attracted the attention of a host of clubs across the continent. That interest will only strengthen given his showings in Qatar, with rumours already circulating that a January move could be in the offing.  But where might he end up?

" Despite winning 2-0, Suarez and Uruguay were dumped out of the World Cup on Friday after South Korea beat Portugal 2-1, meaning the Asian nation qualified on goals scored. Suarez posted on social media following the defeat, slamming critics of his country following their exit.WHAT HE SAID: ""Saying goodbye to a World Cup hurts a lot, but we have the peace of mind that we left everything for our country,"" Suarez said on Instagram. ""Proud to be URUGUAYAN although they DON'T RESPECT US. Thanks to each of the Uruguayans who supported us in every part of the world!"" THE BIGGER PICTURE: As he often is, Suarez has been the centre of attention this week for his comments regarding Asamoah Gyan's missed penalty in the 2010 World Cup quarter-finals. Suarez controversially 'saved' a goal-bound shot, resulting in a penalty and a red card for himself, however Gyan missed the spot-kick and Uruguay eventually defeated Ghana on penalties. Suarez claimed this week that it was not his fault that Ghana were eliminated, as he did not miss the penalty. IN TWO PHOTOS:  It was a real rollercoaster of emotions for Suarez on Friday afternoon... WHAT NEXT FOR SUAREZ? After his World Cup elimination, Suarez's attention will now turn to finding another club after leaving Nacional in his home country. The 35-year-old is rumoured to be keen on a move to MLS.

" After their Copa America triumph, Argentina clinched the Finalissima 2022 trophy by beating Italy and are currently among the favourites to lift the World Cup come December. Lionel Scaloni has got the team working as a unit and Lionel Messi is in good form in the attacking third. After a shock defeat to Saudi Arabia in their opener, they have bounced back strongly with wins against Mexico and Poland to finish top of Group C and progress to the round of 16.  The Albiceleste will face Australia in the next round and if they play to their potential they should get to the quarter-finals.

The Socceroos' best performance in the competition is getting to the round of 16 in Germany in 2006.  They will be hoping to do better this time around after beating Tunisia and Denmark in the group stages.

They picked up two consecutive victories against Qatar and Ecuador respectively in the group stage to qualify for the round of 16. Now they are set to face England on Sunday in the battle for a quarter-final berth.

" The USMNT is at the World Cup for the 11th time in their history, back after they failed to qualify for the 2018 edition in Russia altogether. Gregg Berhalter and his men will be desperate to make amends for that performance by going far in Qatar and they sure have the talent to spring a surprise. They've already cleared the first hurdle, escaping from a group that included England, Wales and Iran. And they escaped without a loss, making them one of only five teams at this World Cup to avoid tasting defeat so far. Their reward? A match against one of the other five: the Netherlands.

" There is no denying that it has been an exciting start to the 2022 World Cup, with plenty of surprises and spectacular encounters on show in the first two matchdays of the group stages. There was Saudi Arabia's shock win over Argentina, Germany throwing away a one-goal lead versus Japan and Belgium losing to Morocco to name just a few upsets. And there has been no shortage of goals either, with Spain smashing seven past Costa Rica, Cameroon and Serbia playing out a hugely entertaining 3-3 draw and England hammering Iran 6-2. But the question on everyone's mind as we enter matchday three is what all that means for the knockout stages and which teams have already secured progress to the round of 16. Qualified for World Cup round of 16 Netherlands topped Group A, with Senegal coming second ahead of Qatar and Wales. England and the USMNT advance from Group B, while Lionel Messi inspired Argentina to the top of Group C after their opening-game upset against Saudi Arabia. Poland join the Albiceleste as Group C runners-up. France and Australia qualified from Group D, while Morocco sprung an upset on Belgium in Group E and topped the table, with Croatia advancing as the runners-up. Japan were shock winners of Group F, topping the table ahead of Spain and Germany, with Hansi Flick's side bowing out.

" Morgan exchanged a number of messages with the Portugal star, with both joking about his feeling of freedom after leaving the Manchester club. The TV host, whose interview helped Ronaldo get ejected from United, also thought rumours of a Saudi transfer were premature. WHAT THEY SAID: ""I texted Cristiano a GIF of William Wallace in Braveheart shouting: 'Freedom!',"" Morgan revealed. ‚ÄúHe thought that was a perfect summation of how he felt. ‚ÄòFree as a bird‚Äô was his response."" On reports of a blockbuster move to Saudi Arabian club Al-Nassr, Morgan responded: ""He thinks that if he does well at this World Cup, he‚Äôll get what he really wants, which is a club in the Champions League that extends his record and his legacy. It‚Äôs not about money at this stage of his career. It comes down to a burning desire to play football at the highest level, to break records and win trophies. And he has done that in more countries than any other player in history."" THE BIGGER PICTURE: While Ronaldo may be eyeing a move to one of Europe's top teams, his performances at the World Cup aren't helping his chances. A record-breaking opening day penalty caught the headlines, but since then the 37-year-old has underwhelmed, and was personally responsible for South Korea's equaliser against Portugal as they recorded a famous comeback victory on Friday. IN TWO PHOTOS: DID YOU KNOW? Ronaldo has attempted exactly 100 shots at World Cup tournaments, the first player to reach this total since full shot data is available (1966). WHAT NEXT FOR RONALDO?

" Not even Brazil are safe in this tournament of upsets. After Argentina, Germany, Belgium, France and Spain came this latest shock. It didn't cost the Selecao too much, but this 1-0 defeat to Cameroon provided another memorable World Cup moment, and raises questions as to whether Tite's side really should be considered favourites. Vincent Aboubakar's 92nd-minute header secured victory for Cameroon, though it was not enough to secure them qualification to the last 16 due to Switzerland's win over Serbia. Still, this was a famous win for the Indomitable Lions, one to go alongside their famous humbling of Argentina in 1990. Brazil, in fairness, were already sure of qualification - they will face South Korea in the last 16 - and so made nine changes to their starting line-up. But they lost another player, Alex Telles, to injury and coach Tite is still waiting for his vaunted array of attackers to fire.  Gabriel Martinelli, the Arsenal forward, was the best on show here, but Brazil wasted a host of chances before being caught by Aboubakar's late sucker punch.

" TELL ME MORE: Xherdan Shaqiri became only the third player to score at the last three World Cups with his deflected opener getting the ball rolling, although his strike was soon cancelled out by a textbook Aleksandr Mitrovic header. It was Shaqiri's giveaway that led to Serbia's second thanks to an expert Dusan Vlahovic finish, but Breel Embolo was on hand to draw his side level in a blockbuster first 45 minutes. Remo Freuler finished off a fine team move to give the Swiss the advantage shortly after the break, as Murat Yakin's side held out for all three points. THE MVP: Xherdan Shaqiri. Being among the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi is some pretty impressive company. Shaqiri's fifth ever World Cup goal saw him score in his third successive tournament thanks to a close-range strike which got Switzerland off to a winning start. He also played a part in his side's decisive third goal and was a constant menace to Serbia's defence before being substituted on 69 minutes. THE BIG LOSER: Whoever chose to watch the Brazil game! While Tite's men may have slipped to a shock defeat to Cameroon in Group G's other match, it was an uneventful affair compared to this one. Serbia and Switzerland treated viewers to five goals, four of which came in the first half alone. While the second half may have petered out slightly, it was still a contender for game of the tournament. Big L for those who chose not to tune in.

" Stones has joined the likes of Gary Neville in heaping praise on the 22-year-old who hasn't played his way into Gareth Southgate's plans just yet, despite many a player and pundit saying Foden should be starting.  WHAT THEY SAID: Speaking in a press conference, Stones said: ""I've never seen anyone like Phil, at that age, with his ability and his football knowledge. It is the freedom in how he plays and how he expresses himself. It is frightening. I am a huge fan of him. I am lucky to play with him every day. I am lucky, Man City are lucky and England are lucky.""

He only started one of England's three group games and sat out the 0-0 draw against the USMNT completely. But after scoring against Wales he may have forced his way into the team for the knockout stages.  WHAT NEXT FOR FODEN? While it's almost certain he's seen this tweet because of the traction it has generated, Foden's attention will solely be on England's round of 16 tie against Senegal on Sunday.

" The England captain has been back in training for some time after picking up a foot injury while on international duty in October, and the Gunners have now confirmed that she is match fit. Williamson could feature against Everton on Saturday, with first-choice defensive partner Raffaella Souza also available for selection after a similarly-long lay-off. THE BIGGER PICTURE: Williamson has missed eight games because of her injury but Arsenal have fared well in her absence, with Lotte Wubben-Moy and Steph Catley deputising admirably. The Gunners have won six of those eight fixtures, a run that includes a 5-1 win away to Lyon,  4-0 win at Leicester and a 3-1 win at home against West Ham.  WHAT THEY SAID?: Speaking about Williamson's long-awaited return, Arsenal coach Jonas Eidevall said: ""It helps us a lot because we get two more players of very high quality into our environment. That will boost any team and it certainly does for us. Leah is very motivated to get back onto the pitch and to help the team achieve things."" IN TWO PHOTOS:     WHAT NEXT FOR WILLIAMSON? While it's unlikely that the defender will start against Everton, she may well play some part in the game.

" Spain have won the World Cup just once in their history, but La Roja will be upbeat about their chances in Qatar 2022.  They crashed out in the round of 16 in Russia after being beaten by the hosts on penalties. They went a step further in Euro 2020 and reached the semi-finals before being ousted by eventual champions Italy, once again via spot kicks.  What will Spain need to do to become world champions for the second time? GOAL takes a look at the Spaniards' potential route to the final. Spain's World Cup group stage finish Spain started their World Cup campaign with a historic 7-0 win over Costa Rica. However, they could not keep up their brilliant start as they were held by Germany to a 1-1 draw and then suffered to a 2-1 defeat to Japan on matchday three.  Spain's last-16 opponents Spain have finished runners-up in Group E which means they will face the toppers from Group F. Morocco emerged as group champions in that pool ahead of Croatia, which means Luis Enrique's men will take on the African nation for a place in the quarter-finals of the competition on Tuesday. The game will go ahead on December 6, 2022, at the Education City Stadium, and will kick off at 3pm GMT (10am ET). Spain's possible quarter-final opponents If Spain beat Morocco, they will face Portugal, who won Group H, or the runner-up of Group G (Brazil/Switzerland/Cameroon/Serbia). That quarter-final will take place at 3pm GMT (10am ET) on December 10, at the Al Thumama Stadium. Spain's possible semi-final opponents If Spain make it through to the semi-finals, they will face either England/Senegal or France/Poland. The semi-final will take place on December 14 at 7pm GMT (2pm ET) at the Al Bayt Stadium. Spain's possible World Cup final opponents It's difficult to predict exactly who Spain could face in a potential final but, they will meet a team from the other side of the bracket. Netherlands, United States, Argentina, Australia, Japan and Croatia are all potential opponents. There are also the winners of G or South Korea. The World Cup 2022 final will be played on December 18, 2022. The game kicks off at 3pm GMT (10am ET).

" Spain failed to win Group E thanks to a three-minute second-half turnaround that was completed by a controversial Ao Tanaka goal. The result meant Spain scraped through to the knockout stages ahead of Germany on virtue of goal difference. The performance was a far cry from the one Spain produced in the 7-0 win over Costa Rica, and the coach admitted that his team's collapse left him ""annoyed"".  WHAT THEY SAID: He continued to vent his frustration, saying at a press conference: ""I have nothing to celebrate, I'm not at all happy. I wanted to be first in the group and win this match. I warned the players at half time that Japan would come out on top but we went into collapse mode. I repeat: I have nothing to celebrate."" THE BIGGER PICTURE: Despite his warranted concerns, Spain are through to the knockout stages for the second consecutive World Cup after failing to get out of the group stages in the 2014 edition.

" We've all heard the famous saying about an irresistible force meeting an immovable object. And we're all going to see it play out on Saturday at Khalifa International Stadium. That irresistible force is one Cody Gakpo, the world's most in-form attacker. The Dutch starlet has taken his game into a new stratosphere, dominating the Eredivisie before making the World Cup his playground with three goals in as many games. He has 21 goal contributions in 14 Eredivisie games this season and he's scored with his left, right and his head since arriving in Qatar.  Gakpo, statistically, is the best attacker in the world right now. As for the immovable object, meet the U.S. men's national team's defense. Three games, one goal, none from open play. They've stifled the likes of Harry Kane and, at least mostly, Gareth Bale. Pretty good competition by any stretch. They've survived periods in which they've dominated and periods in which they've been dominated. Three different centerbacks have started, and each has had a part to play in leading the USMNT to the knockout stages.  The USMNT, statistically, is right there among the best defensive teams in this World Cup. Entering Friday's games, every other team that has finished the group stage has conceded at least once from open play. So, now what? Cody Gakpo is the breakout star of this World Cup üìà pic.twitter.com/ryKcIPgZ7c It's hard to reduce a game like Saturday's round-of-16 clash between the USMNT and the Netherlands to one matchup, simply because there are too many storylines to keep track of.  There's Sergino Dest's clash with his home country and Gregg Berhalter's extended stay in Holland as a player. There's the injury to Christian Pulisic, the illness of Frenkie de Jong. Memphis Depay is in the news for trying to choose his own partner up top, while the USMNT's striker situation remains very much in flux. It'll take a combination of things for either side to win this game and book their quarterfinal spot but, in many ways, looking at Gakpo's battle with the USMNT defense is a good place to start. The dynamic 23-year-old is arguably the star of this World Cup, at least so far. He was already making waves with his play for PSV, but the hype has reached overdrive in Qatar. At some point soon, some Premier League club will pay a bazillion dollars for him. That's what happens when you perform in the way he has. Gakpo is actually that damn good.  He hasn't had as many chances as some other forwards, but he surely hasn't wasted the ones he's gotten. Gakpo is one of those players that needs just one opportunity to change a game and, ultimately, a World Cup. So, how does the USMNT counteract that? Well, Berhalter has been doing his homework. ""We've been watching Holland for the last 11 months, watching all their games,"" he said. ""We've had multiple people at their group stage games watching live with the wide angle, so we're gonna do a deep dive on them.  ""All the information was presented to us immediately after the game against Iran and we were able to start preparing."" ""We're looking at how they play, at what they do, how they create chances, how they press,"" Berhalter continued. ""Every face of the play, we're analyzing. We're looking at set pieces, the whole thing."" Credit to Berhalter and his scouting team for how the U.S. has been able to neutralize opponents so far. But credit to the players themselves, too, all of whom have stepped up to a level few saw coming. The centerbacks deserve plenty of credit, especially Tim Ream. How good has he been? For a player that, just a few months ago, was nowhere near the national team picture, Ream has been better than anyone could have ever imagined.  During this World Cup, he's been partnered by two different teammates. Walker Zimmerman started against Wales and England before coming on late against Iran to swat away cross after cross.  Cameron Carter-Vickers, meanwhile, stepped in against Iran, with Berhalter pointing to his ability to play against a team in a low block thanks to his time at Celtic. It hasn't just been the centerbacks, though. Dest has been marvelous at fullback, looking like a completely different player than the one that was, to put it lightly, disinterested when it came to defending for several years.  Antonee Robinson has been his steady self but Tyler Adams has gone supersonic, emerging as an elite defensive midfielder at the most elite level. When you add in the pressing work done by Haji Wright and Josh Sargent up top, you get a clear vision of how the U.S. defend: with everyone doing their part. That is how you generally stop a player like Gakpo. You don't stop him when he gets the ball; you stop him before he gets it. And the USMNT defense has put that line of thinking on full display twice this tournament. Against Wales, the U.S. put Bale in an on-pitch prison cell. He was constantly surrounded by Zimmerman, Ream and the three midfielders. Whenever the ball would go anywhere near him, the door would slam shut, taking away Bale as an option. Then, against England, the U.S. earmarked the centerbacks as the initiators of the Three Lions attack, so they hounded them, not allowing John Stones or Harry Maguire to play with the ball.  It led to a disjointed attacking performance from England as the job was made easier for those deeper in defense thanks to the work of those up front. The USMNT will need to apply those principles against the Netherlands. They'll need to put Virgil van Dijk under pressure. They'll need to surround midfield playmaker De Jong.  And, most importantly, they'll have to make sure that Gakpo never, ever gets the ball in a place where he can make something happen. ""They have some real talent with Memphis Depay and Gakpo and [Steven] Bergwijn, just really top-end talent,"" Berthalter said, ""but for us, it's about the collective.  ""The backline has done a great job. The goalkeeper has done a great job, but it's about team defending, working as a unit, moving collectively. ""And when we do that, we put the opponent in difficult positions where they can't access the spaces they want to access. I think that's been what we've been good at so far."" It's never that easy though, is it? The whole world knows about Gakpo, and Netherlands manager Louis van Gaal knows that the whole world knows about Gakpo. The Dutch boss isn't going to sit back and let things play out; he's going to put his players in a position to shine. He's no doubt been watching hours of film on the U.S. after admitting that, prior to arriving in Qatar, he'd never seen Berhalter's side play.  ""If you watch them play, it's crystal clear they've had opportunities,"" Van Gaal said. ""I don't think it's a surprise to be quite honest.  ""The USA has an excellent 'team'. I would say one of the best 'teams', fine-tuned. It's going to be a very tough match. But it's nothing we can't overcome. We also have a good team, that's my view.  ""We'll have to wait and see in this match which of the two squads is the best. I'm not going to downplay the USA. On the contrary, they're an example of what a good team is supposed to be."" As Van Gaal says, this will be a battle of two talented teams. On paper, the Netherlands may have slightly more quality, but you can't write off a U.S. team that has already gone toe-to-toe with England.  And, in a World Cup, you can never write off a team that has had a defense like the USMNT's. It's hard to lose if you don't concede, right? Saturday's game will likely be a tight, tense affair defined by battles all over the field. The most important of those battles will be between Gakpo and a USMNT defense that will be designed to keep him quiet. They've kept superstars quiet before, though. Who wins, then? Does the force of Gakpo finally meet resistance? Can the Dutch starlet move the immovable?  We're about to find out... Which was the best World Cup winning team?

" Suarez's criticisms extended towards the penalty given against Uruguay's Josema Gimenez and the one not awarded for a supposed foul on forward Darwin Nunez. The veteran striker then took shots at football's governing body, claiming FIFA take advantage over Uruguay due to its lack of ""power"". WHAT THEY SAID: ""The Josema (Gimenez) penalty was detrimental to us because of the goals conceded and so was the one given to Darwin,"" Suarez protested. ""The people at FIFA and the Referees Committee have to give explanations as to what they are basing their decision to award the incredible penalties that are being awarded and we didn't get two today. ""It's not an excuse, but we also have to respond to that lack of power. After the game I wanted to see my children and the FIFA people told me no, when a France player was with his children on the bench. It seems that Uruguay has to have more power, FIFA is always against Uruguay."" THE BIGGER PICTURE: Suarez's complaints echo the unsavoury scenes at the final whistle which saw Uruguay players and coaching staff surround the referee in protest. Despite the Celeste beating Ghana 2-0 on the night, a late Hwang Hee-chan winner against Portugal sent South Korea through to the last 16 on goals scored, leaving Suarez and Co. visibly distraught both on and off the pitch. IN THREE PHOTOS: DID YOU KNOW? Suarez was the only player in the starting line-ups for Ghana-Uruguay who also started the 2010 World Cup quarter-final between the two teams. He was shown a red card for a deliberate handball in that match. WHAT NEXT FOR SUAREZ?

" Ronaldo and Lee Sung-Jae had a couple of words as the Portuguese talisman made way for Andre Silva 65 minutes into South Korea's 2-1 win, a victory that saw them through to the knockout stages in second place behind Portugal. Ronaldo's reaction left viewers confused as to why he seemed unhappy about coming off knowing his side's place in the knockouts was secured. However, it was something Lee said that caused the reaction.  WHAT THEY SAID: Speaking soon after the defeat, Santos said: ""Cristiano Ronaldo left upset because a Korean player was sending him away and Pepe even had to intervene. I heard what the Korean player was saying. If you see the images, you see Pepe going after the South Korean because of that."" Ronaldo also gave his view on the situation, saying: ""What happened was that, before my departure, the player from Korea told me to leave quickly. I told him to shut up. He has no authority, he doesn't have to give an opinion, he would speed up the pace if he were the referee. But there doesn‚Äôt have to be controversy, things stay on the pitch.""

" Daniel Siebert blew his whistle after 10 minutes of stoppage time, bringing Uruguay's World Cup campaign to an end as they finished third in Group H. Realising that they had gone out, several players took their anger out on the officials after they failed to award Edinson Cavani a penalty following a coming together with Alidu Seidu late on.

" Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal and Luis Suarez's Uruguay had been paired together in Group H of the 2022 World Cup alongside Ghana and South Korea. Portugal topped the group with two wins and a loss, earning six points. The Portuguese won their first two games in the group stage, first a 3-2 win over Ghana and then a 2-0 win over Uruguay. However, a loss against South Korea in the final group game halted their momentum. South Korea surprised everyone with a win over Portugal in a must-win game in the final group game, with Hwang Hee-chan scoring a stoppage-time winner to give his team a 2-1 lead. They had collected just one point from the first two games, and edged Uruguay on goals scored. Uruguay bowed out of the World Cup in group stage even after winning their final group game against Ghana. They were tied on points with South Korea and had the same goal difference, but finished below the Asian giants due to their inferior goals tally. Ghana played well in this World Cup, but could manage to bag just three points in the group stage. They finished last in Group H.",football
" The United States men's national team will look to spring an upset and continue their quest for a maiden World Cup trophy when they face the Netherlands in the last 16 on Saturday. The USMNT finished second in Group B following an unbeaten run which saw them pick up draws against England and Wales and a win against Iran in their last match. The Netherlands, meanwhile, finished top of Group A with seven points from three matches. The US are battling it out for only the third quarter-finals in the nation's history, while the Oranje will play in their sixth ever World Cup quarter-final with a victory. With all that at stake, who is the person running the rule over the game? GOAL brings you everything you need to know. Who is the referee for Netherlands vs USMNT? Wilton Sampaio is the referee who will officiate the World Cup 2022 last-16 tie between Netherlands and USMNT. Born on December 28, 1981, Wilton Sampaio is a Brazilian referee, who is affiliated to CONMEBOL and has been a FIFA-listed official since 2013. Which other World Cup 2022 games has Wilton Sampaio refereed? Sampaio has been the referee for two World Cup 2022 group games so far. The round of 16 game between the Netherlands and the U.S. men's national team is his third match. He was the chief official for the Group A clash between Senegal and the Netherlands on November 21, which the Dutch won 2-0.  After that, Sampaio took charge of the Group C game between Poland and Saudi Arabia on November 26, which Poland won 2-0 thanks to goals from Piotr Zielinski and Robert Lewandowski.  Who are the assistant referees & fourth official? Sampaio will be assisted by Bruno Boschilla and Bruno Pires, who will run the line on either side of the pitch.  Andres Mathias Matonte is the fourth official. Which was the best World Cup winning team? Which was the best World Cup winning team?",football
" Cristiano Ronaldo and goals are synonymous with one another and the Manchester United attacker is the benchmark for every young forward who aspires to make it big.  Over the course of his 20-year career, the Portuguese has broken records wherever he played and he continues to do just that even at the age of 37. While Ronaldo will primarily be known for his stints at Real Madrid and Manchester United, he also shone when playing for Juventus and Sporting CP.  His rivalry with PSG forward Lionel Messi during the last decade elevated football as a whole, giving spectators performances that may never be seen again.  But just how many goals has he scored?

Many top European clubs had been linked with the coveted RB Leipzig defender even before the tournament, and he has now revealed that he would be interested in joining Madrid in the future.  WHAT THEY SAID: As reported by Relevo, Gvardiol said: ""Real Madrid is the biggest club in the world, so who knows... maybe one day I can play there. I would like to, yes."" The 20-year-old also revealed national team-mate Luka Modric would not need to convince him to join him at the Bernabeu, adding: ""Luka doesn't have to tell me anything about Real Madrid, it's not necessary. I already know everything, I know it's the biggest club in the world and how important it is to be linked to a team like that,"" explained Gvardiol. THE BIGGER PICTURE: The young defender is one of the brightest prospects in football right now and he's already been linked with Chelsea. Gvardiol has made 20 appearances for RB Leipzig this campaign and his World Cup performances will no doubt boost his reputation further. IN TWO PHOTOS:  WHAT NEXT FOR GVARDIOL?

" It's the most talked about decision of the World Cup so far... and finally we have a proper explanation from FIFA! After Kaoru Mitoma smuggled the ball back across the face of Spain's goal, Tanaka slotted home to score Japan's second goal in three minutes to put them ahead in the match. The goal was eventually given after a long VAR check but there were many who believed that it was clear the ball had gone out of play.  WHY WAS IT GIVEN? The simple fact is that not all of the ball had crossed the line before Mitoma got to it. Indeed, FIFA has even released a video to show that certain camera angles can be deceptive! Other cameras may offer misleading images but on the evidence available, the whole of the ball was not out of play. pic.twitter.com/HKKEot0j1Y STORY IN TWO PHOTOS:  Which was the best World Cup winning team?

" After the World Cup group stages comes to a close, the top two nations from each group enter a 16-team knockout. The winner of each match will progress from the round of 16 to the quarter-final, semi-final and eventually, the final. But what if both sides are level after 90 minutes? To help you get up to speed, GOAL brings you everything you need to know about how extra time and penalties work in the World Cup. When does a game go to extra time? Games go to extra time in the knockout stages of a tournament when both teams are level after regulation time.  Some knockout tournaments, such as the English FA Cup, have a 'replay' following a draw, which involves the same fixture played with the home and away sides reversed.  Given that a World Cup is played at a neutral venue (apart from for the host nation), this method isn't feasible, meaning extra time is the adopted format in the knockout stages. How long is extra time in football? Extra time consists of two halves of 15 minutes amounting to 30 extra minutes in total. Extra time is not to be confused with 'added time', which describes the minutes added on to each half due to stoppages in play (e.g. an injury, substitution, goal celebrations, etc.).  Extra time can have its own 'added time' at the end of each half, although this is usually no more than a few minutes due to the shortness of the periods. When does a game go to penalties? If both teams are level after 120 minutes of football, including any necessary 'added time', the game will go to a penalty shootout.  While this is not always the case in tournaments that employ the 'away goals' rule, this again is not used at the World Cup given that it is held at a neutral venue.  This means all tied games after 120 minutes will go to a penalty shootout, more commonly referred to as simply 'penalties'. How many penalties are taken in a shootout? Each team takes five penalties each. The spot kicks can be taken by any player who finished the game on the pitch, including the goalkeeper, but cannot be taken by any of the substitutes. The team to score the most of their five penalties wins the game and goes through to the next round. What order are penalties hit in? Penalties are taken in alternating order - so team A, team B, team A, team B, and so on. The team to take the first spot kick is decided by a coin toss before the shootout, and the referee chooses which goal the penalties will be taken in. What is sudden-death in penalty shootouts? Sudden-death is used when both teams are still level after their respective five spot kicks. If the scores are equal after five kicks, each team will have one penalty each to try and score until the other fails.  So, if team A scores their kick, team B must score theirs to stay in the game. If team A misses, team B must score to win. If both miss or both score, the sudden-death continues until one team has the advantage and therefore eventually progresses to the next round.

" The Netherlands have joined the likes of Spain and Brazil in having flu-like symptoms in their squad during the World Cup. This could be a direct result of the massive air conditioning units that have been installed to keep the temperature at pitch-level bearable for the players.

There are not fifteen or so [affected]. In principle, everyone is fit and available.""

" USMNT coach Gregg Berhalter has suggested he is unsure how best to use Gio Reyna at the World Cup having only brought him on once but insists the talented playmaker can have an impact for his team in the knockout stages of the tournament. WHAT THEY SAID: Speaking to reporters on Friday, Berhalter said of Reyna's lack of minutes: ""I think a lot of it comes down to timing and circumstance. If you look at how the games have unfolded, we've had the lead and had to hold on to the lead later in games. The only game that we didn't have that scenario, we actually put him in to help get the victory. So it's just how we can use him in the most effective way. He's a really talented player and we're looking for the right moment but he can no doubt help this team."" THE BIGGER PICTURE: Berhalter is right in his assertion that his side have led games in the group stage and so a more defensive approach was needed. Acknowledging Reyna's talent, the 20-year-old can be a key creator from the bench when it's win or bust in the knockouts.  IN A PHOTO:  WHAT NEXT?

" Argentina have won the World Cup twice in their history (1978 & 1986) and the Albiceleste will fancy their chances of going all the way in Qatar 2022 after a hiatus of 36 years. They beat arch-rivals Brazil in the 2021 Copa America final to lift the trophy at the Maracana Stadium and will be hoping to repeat their heroics on the world stage at Lusail Stadium on December 18. So, what will Argentina and Lionel Messi need to do to ensure the country becomes world champions for the first time since 1986? GOAL takes a look at their potential route to the final. Argentina's World Cup group stage finish Argentina finished top of the group with six points, with Poland coming in two points behind them in second place.  Lionel Scaloni's men started their campaign on a disappointing note as they lost 2-1 to Saudi Arabia, but came strongly with two consecutive 2-0 victories against Mexico and Poland.  Argentina's last-16 opponents Argentina have finished top of Group C which means they will face the runners-up from Group D. Australia finished behind France in that pool, so Argentina will go up against the Socceroos in the round of 16.  The game will go ahead on December 3, 2022 at the Ahmad bin Ali Stadium. The game is set to kick off at 7pm GMT (2pm ET). Argentina's possible quarter-final opponents If Argentina beat Australia, they will face the winner between the Netherlands and the USA.  That quarter-final will take place at 7pm GMT (2pm ET) on December 9, at the Lusail Stadium. Argentina's possible semi-final opponents If Argentina make it through to the semi-finals, they will face either the winners of Japan and Croatia, Groups G or the runners-up of Group H.  That would put them up against Portugal, Ghana, South Korea or Uruguay from Group H, or Brazil, Switzerland, Cameroon or Serbia from Group G. The semi-final will take place on December 13 at 7pm GMT (2pm ET) at Lusail Stadium. Argentina's possible World Cup final opponents As group winners, Argentina will meet a team from the other side of the bracket should they progress to the final. England, Spain, France are all potential opponents. There are also the winners of Groups H and or the runners-up of Group G.

" If South Korea are to have an impact at World Cup 2022 in Qatar, they need Heung-min Son to be on top of his game. The Tottenham star has been dazzling in the Premier League over the past number of seasons and he comes onto football's biggest stage for the third - and potentially final - time with his country. However, the 30-year-old goal-getter is sporting an unusual look when he lines up against Uruguay, Ghana and Portugal in Group H. His face is partially covered by a mask when he plays, but it's not a fashion statement. So what's it all about then? GOAL brings you everything you need to know. Why is Heung-min Son wearing a mask at the World Cup? Heung-min Son is wearing a face mask at the World Cup as a protective measure after suffering a facial injury while playing for his club. The mask is designed to shield the facial bones from impact and thus it minimises the risk of further injury, which could affect his chances of playing. Son sustained the injury while playing for Tottenham in a Champions League clash against Marseille at the beginning of November, suffering a fractured eye socket when he collided with Chancel Mbemba. The eye injury required surgery to ensure a full recovery and concerns mounted that it would rule him out of the South Korea World Cup squad. ""We can confirm that Heung-Min Son will undergo surgery to stabilise a fracture around his left eye,"" a statement from Tottenham explained. ""Following surgery, Son will commence rehabilitation with our medical staff and we shall update supporters further in due course."" However, the prognosis was positive for the Tigers of Asia and he was passed fit to play. In an Instagram post, Son said: ""Playing for your country at the World Cup is the dream of so many children growing up, just as it was one of mine too. ""I won‚Äôt miss this for the world. I can‚Äôt wait to represent our beautiful country, see you soon. Sonny."" While face masks are not a common sight in football, a number of high profile players have worn them while playing. Antonio Rudiger, for example, wore one while playing for Germany at Euro 2020, while Chelsea star Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang had to don one back in September. Interestingly, while Aubameyang needed to wear the mask while playing due to injury, he has also produced superhero masks as part of celebrations. Others have mimicked this approach, with Mexico striker Raul Jimenez doing likewise in games for Benfica and Wolves. Where to buy protective face masks Protective face masks are medical equipment and can be sourced through a hospital, doctor or pharmacist. As well as eye injuries, they are designed to protect a broad range of facial bones, such as the nose, cheek and orbital. They can cost from $60/¬£60 upwards and you should consult with a doctor if you believe you should wear one. Who will progress to the FIFA World Cup quarter-finals?

WHAT THEY SAID: Chelsea captain Azpilicueta, who was replaced at half-time by Dani Carvajal, has addressed claims that La Roja threw in the towel against Japan, telling reporters: ‚ÄúI was aware in the second half [of the Germany score]; I was on the bench so I was aware of the situation.

But the U.S. has not faced something of this level just yet as they look ahead to the knockout rounds. Christian Pulisic is dealing with a pelvic contusion, having suffered the injury scoring his heroic goal against Iran. The U.S. is hopeful he'll play, but it isn't a certainty.

" Portugal will look to carry their winning momentum against South Korea when they lock horns at the Education City Stadium. Fernardo Santos' side have sealed qualification for the Round of 16 and are likely to finish as Group H winners, unless they lose to South Korea and Ghana win against Uruguay to have a superior goal difference to Portugal. The coach did hint at changes in the starting XI, so we should expect a fully-rotated squad. As for South Korea, they face a Herculean task against the Euro 2016 champions. With just one point from their two games, they will need a win and hope for a draw between Ghana and Uruguay to have a chance of qualifying for the Round of 16. South Korea XI (4-2-3-1): Seung-gyu; Moon-hwan, Young-gwonm, Kyung-won Kwon, Jin-su; In-beom Hwang, Jung; Kang-in Lee, Jae-sung Lee, Son; Cho Portugal XI (4-1-2-1-2): Diogo Costa, Dalot, Pepe, Ant√≥nio Silva, Cancelo; Neves; Nunes, Vitinha; Jo√£o M√°rio; Horta, Ronaldo South Korea can finish only as high as second in this group provided the game between Ghana and Uruguay ends in a draw. But, they will have to win by a two-goal margin. They will most likely face Brazil in the Round of 16, provided they win or draw against Cameroon. Portugal are most likely to finish as Group H table toppers, regardless of the result. With any team from Brazil, Cameroon, Switzerland, and Serbia possible to finish second. However, if Ghana win by a two-goal margin and Portugal lose by a two-goal margin, Ghana will finish as winners of the group. Which was the best World Cup winning team?

" After being knocked out by Uruguay in the 2010 World Cup, Ghana have an opportunity to revenge their loss as they face Uruguay with both teams looking for a win to secure their qualification chances. Ghana have their qualification fate in their own hands, a victory against Uruguay would see them through to the round of 16. After producing a jaw-dropping comeback against South Korea in their previous fixture, the African nation would be confident of taking three points from the fixture. The last time Ghana made it to the knockout stages of a World Cup was back in 2010 when a Luis Suarez handball and a missed penalty ended their fairytale. But if the Black Stars win they could go through and sent Uruguay home. For Uruguay the calculations are simple, if they win against a strong Ghana team, they would go through but a loss or a draw would see them leave Qatar. Dieogo Alonso‚Äôs side have had a lackluster tournament opening their account with a goalless draw against South Korea before being triumphed by Portugal in their second fixture. Uruguay would want their forwards to step-up and bag them their first goal in Qatar if they want a chance to qualify for the round of 16. Ghana XI (4-2-3-1): Ati-Zigi; Lamptey, Amartey, Salisu, Baba; Partey, Samed; Kudus, A Ayew, J Ayew; Williams Uruguay XI (4-4-2): Rochet; Olivera, Gimenez, Coates, Varela; Arrascaeta, Valverde, Bentancur, Pellistri; Nunez, Suarez  Ghana are predicted to finish second in the group and they would encounter Brazil on the 6th of December.

Another Three Lions team-mate is asked to control the midfield, with plenty of goals up top, but Maguire has stopped short of naming a goalkeeper, which may make it difficult for his side to keep opponents out. WHAT THEY SAID: Maguire, who is on 2022 World Cup duty with his country, has told the Lions' Den when asked for his dream 5-a-side team: ‚ÄúStonesy [John Stones] at the back. I‚Äôd go for Harry Kane up top, whenever we play five-a-side he‚Äôs top goalscorer every time. I‚Äôd put Cristiano in there. Those two together, you‚Äôve won the game already.

The kid at RB Leipzig that's been linked with Chelsea, Nkunku. Centre forward is obviously the big position that needs filling. We have Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford who can both play there, but I think Marcus prefers being out wide and Anthony's injury record isn't great. January might be too soon (to replace Ronaldo), they're probably looking at next summer now, but I do think there are players out there. ‚ÄúThe lad at PSV, Gakpo, is doing well for the Netherlands at the World Cup and I think Ten Hag has been interested in him before.

WHAT THEY SAID: Gvardiol has told The Athletic when asked about supposed interest from England: ‚ÄúAbout me and Chelsea? I don‚Äôt know. You know what happened in the last few months. To be honest, I have no idea. My agent is taking care of this and we will see. Right now, I‚Äôm happy in Leipzig. I don‚Äôt know, we will see ‚Äì you never know.

" The five-time Ballon d‚ÄôOr winner has seen a lucrative contract at Old Trafford ripped up, allowing him to become a free agent, with an explosive interview with Piers Morgan, in which he took aim at prominent figures from the Red Devils‚Äô past and present, making his position with Premier League heavyweights untenable. Ronaldo had already made one push for the exits over the summer, only to see the transfer deadline pass with no deal done, and Stam believes the Portuguese knew exactly what he was doing from that point after seeing game time limited under Erik ten Hag. WHAT THEY SAID: Former United defender Stam, speaking in association with Football Betting, has told GOAL of the long-running Ronaldo saga: ‚ÄúHe did it on purpose. There was a strategy behind it in terms of ‚Äòhow are we going to organise this so that I can leave the club?‚Äô From the beginning to now, you could see where it was going. Not playing, not being in the team, being subbed, not being used, walking away and then saying, from United‚Äôs point of view as well, we spoke about it and the discussion about who is right in all these situations. In everything that has been going on, it‚Äôs been arranged in how it needs to be to leave the club. The next step was to give an interview and say certain things that is going to blow up and eventually you are going to be leaving. It‚Äôs not a good situation. I always questioned the way of working with him and how it started when he joined the club, how the conversations went with Ronaldo, then the decision making about not using him. And from Ronaldo as well, when he said ‚ÄòI want to leave and go somewhere else‚Äô, maybe they could have come to an agreement and parted ways at the beginning of the season. Then it kept dragging on and now with this interview, he knew by saying certain things and making comments about the manager and the club and the owners, they needed to let him go.‚Äù THE BIGGER PICTURE: Pressed further on whether Ronaldo had started to believe that he was bigger than the club, Stam ‚Äì who formed part of United‚Äôs legendary 1999 treble-winning squad ‚Äì added: ‚ÄúThe club is the most important thing. He knows that, his agent knows that, everybody knows that. The thing is that everybody also knows that Ronaldo is a very good player and he still is a big player, a big name in the world of football, a big influence in everything he does with attention on him. He feels that he is still very important, was very important or could be very important for the club ‚Äì which in a way I agree with ‚Äì but the manager is making different decisions. How those things have been dealt with, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs been good. Maybe from the club, they could have done it a bit differently, but also from Ronaldo and his point of view, he should have known better and how to handle certain situations. If you are that experienced, have played so many games and won so many trophies ‚Äì as an individual as well ‚Äì both parties could have solved the situation better.‚Äù IN THREE PHOTOS: WHAT NEXT?

" ‚ÄúUnique‚Äù, something ‚Äúthat has never happened before‚Äù. And it‚Äôs all taking place in Yaounde, Cameroon. Five years ago, a project began to develop a structure that could get more kids into football in one of Africa‚Äôs most successful nations. Today, it is a fully operational league ‚Äì La Ligue D'Egalite, 'the equality league' ‚Äì and is endorsed by La Liga, one of football‚Äôs biggest brands. When GOAL asks Tresor Penku, the Spanish league's delegate in Cameroon and Central Africa, what it was about the idea that so appealed to him, he doesn‚Äôt have to think twice to answer. ‚ÄúBuilding a platform that didn't exist in the country,‚Äù he replies. ‚ÄúIn many African countries, you have a lot of tournaments around the place, but for boys. You have leagues around the communities, but for boys. You have parents who will say, 'Oh, my daughter loves football, but can't play because it's with the boys.' ‚ÄúSo, I was like, 'Oh, this is actually interesting, because we have many young girls who really want to play football. But where do they play football? Why do they play? How do they play?‚Äô ‚ÄúNow, even if we have been able to impact close to 600, many still want to play and we are discovering that. ""The growth has also been due to the fact that there are many young girls out there who need a platform to play football and we are just giving them the opportunity.‚Äù Cameroon is a football mad nation and one of Africa‚Äôs very best.  Five-time champions on the continent on the men‚Äôs side, their run to the quarter-finals of the 1990 World Cup and Roger Milla‚Äôs dancing is a fondly recalled memory for many outside of the country, never mind within, while Samuel Eto'o is arguably the continent's greatest ever footballer. The women‚Äôs team is growing in stature, too, reaching the final of the Africa Cup of Nations in 2014 and 2016, and the knockout stages of the last two World Cup tournaments.  A look through their squad and you‚Äôll see top clubs represented, with Ajara Nchout at Inter while Michaela Abam and Estelle Johnson play in one of the world's best leagues, in the United States. But look at the opportunities available to the children in Cameroon wanting to be the next Eto‚Äôo or Nchout and you'll see that the are limited ‚Äì particularly for girls. It was just under a decade ago, then, that the Cameroonian Football Federation reached out to Jordan Cone, who was working at an international school and coaching a women‚Äôs team in Yaounde ‚Äì the country‚Äôs capital. They wanted his help to develop a structure to get more kids into the game. The idea that initiative spawned is called Petrichor, an association model that offers support to local clubs in a variety of ways ‚Äì from equipment and a league structure, to coaching education and pitch improvements. ‚ÄúWhat happens [in Cameroon] is there's a handful of tournaments per year that random people put on. A club might say, 'Hey, we're going to run a tournament in this community in a few months,'"" Paul Dreisbach, the project‚Äôs co-founder, tells GOAL. ‚ÄúWord gets out, academies get all the players they can and they'll practise for a few months, go play in the tournament and then, once it's over, nothing happens for another six months or a year, until there's another tournament. ‚ÄúIf there are a few good players in that tournament, some of these clubs might see them and say, 'Hey, can you come for a trial?' But that's the extent of youth pathways and development right now in Cameroon. ‚ÄúThere are a few select academies that work with exclusive numbers, where they'll host try-outs and only work with 20 kids, but there hasn't been anything like this kind of decentralised and community-based organic entry into the game, because we tried to just get kids playing. ‚ÄúAs far as the girls' league, that's never happened before. It just doesn't exist.‚Äù When Cone ‚Äì who grew up in West Africa but went to university with Dreisbach in the United States ‚Äì was contacted by the federation, he picked up the phone to ring his friend across the Atlantic.  ‚ÄúHey, do you want to help me start something?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúI'm not exactly sure how to work it.‚Äù What followed was a lot of groundwork, building relationships in Cameroon, which has been imperative to the success of La Ligue D'Egalite's launch. ‚ÄúI think because we're flipping the script a bit and being very inclusive of the wider community, working with people and investing into local leaders that were already doing this work, that's where it's a bit unique and gaining some attention because, as far as I know, I haven't seen something like this before,‚Äù Dreisbach says. At first, it was just about football. But then Dreisbach connected with Lola Ogunbote, who works for Goals for Girls, an American non-governmental organisation with a mission statement of ‚Äúuniting girls through football to lead community change‚Äù. ""I was like, 'Well, if you're doing the football side, what's the support? How are they being mentored? What's the messaging that's going on there?'"" Ogunbote tells GOAL of her first interaction with Dreisbach. ‚ÄúHe was like, 'Oh, it's kind of just football at this time.' I said, 'Well, that's great but we could also come in and help in terms of getting the messaging across about who they are, their values, what they want from life, how they can make change in their communities.  ""'We can provide that leadership, that female empowerment around sport element on top of what you're offering.'‚Äù It was a perfect fit. Ogunbote and her team spoke to female coaches in the area to understand what messaging was needed for girls in Yaounde, came up with a curriculum and added it to the project. It's not the only addition to this programme that deals with more than just playing football. Dreisbach is able to point to a number of ideas and projects in the works that aim to explore different avenues in sport, such as journalism or data analysis, and give young people the chance to open more doors in their future. There is also a lot of work going on behind the scenes to make these clubs in Cameroon self-sufficient, so Petrichor's work is no longer needed. Things were tough to start with, Dreisbach admits.  ""We're talking with families and communities about releasing their girls to come play and focusing just on them, and it's been difficult,‚Äù he explains. But, now, all of this is having quite an impact in the country. ‚ÄúThere are many parents who are resistant to the fact that their girls play football,‚Äù Penku says. ‚ÄúOthers will see what is happening and maybe become more flexible at that point. If their young girl wants to play football, they'll say, 'Go for it!' ‚ÄúThey're coming more and more. It's actually becoming an event for communities. Every weekend, when there's a nice day, not only players come ‚Äì they want to come with their friends, with their families.‚Äù ‚ÄúThree hundred to four hundred girls, literally every week now, can go and play in a league,‚Äù Ogunbote, whose Goals for Girls project isn‚Äôt partnered with La Liga but simply working with Petrichor, says. ‚ÄúThat's phenomenal. I look at that and I think, 'Well, if that's the only contribution I can make in this life, I'm very happy with that.' ""I'm happy to be a part of such a movement in a country that doesn't normally champion girls participating in sport.‚Äù What's next, then? Penku explains that the aim is not to produce professional players like an academy, but it would be a bonus on top of everything else that is going on.  The girls can see that is possible, too, with Cameroon international Catherine Mbengono a regular visitor to those benefiting from Petrichor‚Äôs work. ""That's definitely a great connection for them to see as a role model like, 'Whoa, you came from the same community I live in right now ‚Äì and look at you,'"" Dreisbach explains.  ""That's definitely a big help for us and, along with that exposure, we want to help provide more role models like that.‚Äù Another is Estelle Johnson, who plays for Cameroon and Gotham in the NWSL. She was ‚Äúimmediately drawn‚Äù to what Petrichor is doing and has sent messages to the girls along the way. ‚ÄúThese opportunities are very important not only for the future of our national team but also because participation in football and sports is important to build character, confidence, teamwork and many other life skills,‚Äù she tells GOAL.  ‚ÄúFootball taught me about life and I love seeing the girls have the opportunity to get a taste of that. ‚ÄúMy message to the young, amazing footballers of Cameroon is to follow your heart, dream big, and be consistent with your work. ""If football is something that you want to do, every time you show up to play, be ready. Play hard, enjoy it and never let anyone tell you that your dreams are impossible."" The goal might not be to produce the next Mbengono or Johnson, but who knows? With accessibility and visibility like this, girls in Cameroon have opportunities that simply weren‚Äôt there before. Maybe the next rising star from this great footballing nation will start their story in La Ligue D'Egalite.",football
" Having crashed out in 2018 without reaching the knockout rounds, history has repeated itself for Die Mannschaft four years on. Hansi Flick‚Äôs side were able to see off Costa Rica 4-2 in their final Group E fixture, but an opening 2-1 defeat to Japan proved costly as the Samurai Blue pulled off a shock victory over Spain to progress in the simultaneous game. WHAT THEY SAID: Picking faults in just about every area of Germany‚Äôs game, Manchester City midfielder Gundogan said: ‚ÄúWe concede goals too easily, we lose balls too easily and up front we miss goalscoring chances too easily. Of course, as Germany, we have to have different aspirations, so we have to take a good look at ourselves. We just didn't manage to do our best as a group, or maybe individually. We have to question what the reasons were and everyone has to look in the mirror and tell themselves that it wasn't enough.‚Äù THE BIGGER PICTURE: Joshua Kimmich was another frustrated figure after seeing Germany dumped out of a major tournament in the Middle East, with the versatile Bayern Munich star saying: ‚ÄúThis is definitely the most difficult day of my career for me.

" Ahn Jung-hwan endured a traumatic childhood. Raised by his grandmother after the loss of both of his parents, he never had much growing up. He only started playing football as a kid because his local club offered their players bread and milk. It's perhaps unsurprising, then, that even after turning professional, his post-retirement goals were modest. ""I hope I will be running a small grocery store,"" he revealed, ""and just living in comfort."" Happily, Jung-hwan is doing quite well for himself, albeit not as a green-grocer. He has instead established himself as one of the most famous broadcasters in South Korea. He even has his own YouTube channel. And his success is rooted in one of the most famous goals, in one of the most infamous matches, in World Cup history. An entire book could be written about South Korea's meeting with Italy in Daejeon in 2002. In Italy, the referee, Byron Moreno, remains renowned as one of the biggest villains in football history. Jung-hwan, meanwhile, is remembered for his Golden Goal ‚Äì and the pathetic reaction it provoked from his employer, Perugia president Luciano Gaucci. At the time, the striker was coming off two underwhelming seasons in Serie A, which had featured just five goals in 30 appearances. His confidence was low and he had actually begun the World Cup sitting on the bench. However, South Korea boss Guus Hiddink retained the utmost faith in Jung-hwan. He told him that the tournament would change his life ‚Äì and it did. He came off the bench to score in the group-stage clash with USA, earning his nation a precious point and himself a place in the starting line-up. His most significant contribution, though, would come against his adopted home.  Jung-hwan later confessed that he felt Italy had no chance against a star-studded Italy. However, the last-16 showdown united Korea like no other match, before or since. The Taeguek Warriors even received support from their neighbours to the north, while the fans that descended upon Daejeon on June 18, 2002 revelled in reminding the Azzurri of one of their most humiliating World Cup defeats. 'Again 1966' was the message from the stands, a reference to Italy's loss to North Korea at Goodison Park 38 years previously. Jung-hwan should have opened the scoring, too, but his early penalty was saved by Gigi Buffon. So, when Christian Vieri broke the deadlock, it appeared that a team that also contained Francesco Totti, Alessandro Del Piero and Paolo Maldini would coast to victory. However, Italy's coach, the notoriously pragmatic Giovanni Trapattoni, instead tried to see out the game, and the Azzurri almost inevitably paid the price, with Seol Ki-Hyeon equalising with just two minutes of normal time remaining. By this stage, Moreno's performance ‚Äì and apparent lack of fitness ‚Äì was already coming under scrutiny, and it only intensified when Totti was harshly shown a second yellow card for simulation. Then, with just three minutes to go before penalties, the ball was swung into the Azzurri area. There appeared to be only one winner: Maldini, arguably the greatest defender of all time. Jung-wan, though, got the jump on him ‚Äì literally. He later revealed, ""I actually thought I jumped too early and wouldn't be able to head the ball. But Maldini got his timing wrong because I jumped first. That was a big stroke of luck for me."" There was nothing fortuitous about the finish, though, with Jung-hwan heading home to send Korea into raptures, and Italy into meltdown. Jung-hwan became an instant icon. ""I remember there were so many fans waiting for me that I couldn't go outside,"" he told JoongAng. Indeed, his Golden Goal had generated a wave of euphoria that South Korea rode all the way until the last four. However, in Italy, there was uproar, with many believing Moreno's handling of the game to be evidence of match-fixing. The Gazzetta dello Sport, meanwhile, claimed that this was the latest demonstration of a FIFA-led persecution of the Azzurri. Gaucci, though, focused his frustration on Jung-hwan. ""That man will never set foot in Perugia again,"" he fumed. ""He was a phenomenon only when he played against Italy! ""I am a nationalist and I regard such behaviour not only as an affront to Italian pride but also an offence to a country which two years ago opened its doors to him. ""I have no intention of paying a salary to someone who has ruined Italian football."" The notoriously erratic Gaucci quickly backed down but Jung-hwan was understandably outraged, blaming his boss for creating a toxic atmosphere which he says resulted in his car being vandalised and local news reports of death threats from the mafia. ""It was almost like I had ended my entire football career with that one goal,"" he told JoongAng. Jung-hwan refused to play for Perugia again and what followed was a messy contractual dispute which scuppered his hopes of joining Premier League outfit Blackburn Rovers. In the end, a Japanese firm agreed to pay the ‚Ç¨3.8 million (¬£3.3m/$3.8m) that Gaucci was demanding in compensation, and the forward joined J-League outfit Shimizu S-Pulse. He later acknowledged, ""My life could have been different if I had played in the Premier League, but a lot of people have told me that they were very happy because I was part of the 2002 squad, and I always tell them, no, you made me happy. ""I think that $3.8m is the price I paid for the respect and love I have received from the people."" Jung-hwan, then, has no regrets, and rightly so. The controversy which surrounded South Korea-Italy, and the subsequent fallout, had absolutely nothing to do with him. He did absolutely nothing wrong. As he said himself in an interview with FIFA+, ""There's no law stating I'm not allowed to score against Italy. When I look back, I would swap my whole career for that one goal.""

" It was too little, too late for Germany as they crashed out of the World Cup despite beating Costa Rica 4-2 on Thursday night.  Hansi Flick's team were dominant from the beginning of the match as they chased the vital victory they needed to surely put them through. They did their bit and got the three points but with Japan incredibly beating Spain it wasn't enough. The tension was evident. Germany buckled initially as Costa Rica found a way back into the game, with Manuel Neuer and Antonio Rudiger producing moments of madness to allow their opponents to take a shock lead. Serge Gnabry and Kai Havertz were there to rescue Flick's side, however, with the Bayern Munich winger chipping in with the opening goal and a vital assist, while the Chelsea forward came off the bench to score twice.  Having lost to Japan, drawn with Spain and then allowed Costa Rica to give them a real scare in what should have been an easy win going by the first-half performance, few would argue that Germany really deserved a place in the next round of the tournament. They were simply too inconsistent and sloppy in the key moments in this competition and although they may turn their anger towards VAR following a controversial call in the clash between Spain and Japan, they must first acknowledge their own shortcomings in Qatar.",football
" Japan came from a goal down to win their final match of the round to book their place in the last 16 of the competition. Hajime Moriyasu's team turned the match around with two goals in quick succession as Ritsu Doan equalised three minutes after the restart and then Ao Tanaka put his team ahead shortly afterwards. The result ensures Japan go through as Group E winners and Spain go into the knockout rounds as runners-up. WHAT THEY SAID: ""There were five minutes of panic. They scored two goals against us and could have scored another two,"" Luis Enrique said to La1. ""When a team like Japan has nothing to lose, it happens that they fly like airplanes. Then it went back to normal. The end was already very difficult, because they were very closed. Japan goes first and it is deserved. It annoys me. I wanted to be first."" THE BIGGER PICTURE: VAR played a vital intervention for Japan as their second goal was the subject of a lengthy review as it was thought the ball may have gone out of play in the build up. It was eventually decided that the whole ball had not crossed the line, though, and the goal stood. That ensured Japan went through and Germany, finishing third in the group on goal difference, went out. IN THREE PHOTOS:   DID YOU KNOW?

" Football is never as simple as it looks. In a World Cup group containing two former winners of the illustrious prize, alongside two nations who are largely considered minnows in the game, the very real possibility that the two former winners could go out was simply incomprehensible. But alas, that reality came to be. At least for a while. Spain strolled into half-time with a 1-0 lead and looked comfortable. However, a rally from Japan saw them burst into a 2-1 lead after the break thanks to the iconic Ritsu Doan and a rather controversial strike from Ao Tanaka. Fair or not, Japan had a lead against the 2010 world champions, having already beaten the 2014 champions in Qatar. And with Germany stuttering against Costa Rica elsewhere in Group E, there was a (very) brief moment where both Japan and Costa Rica were advancing at the expense of Spain and Germany. Kai Havertz fired in for 2-2 to ensure that didn't happen, which ultimately spared Spain's blushes as it ensured they progressed to the knockout stages, albeit in second place. Germany would end up winning 4-2, but needed a favour that never came from the Spaniards in order to progress themselves.

Germany were the other victim of the Japanese efficiency, falling to a 2-1 defeat in the opening group game and leaving them with a mountain to climb. In the final group game against Costa Rica, Hansi Flick's side were leading 1-0 at half-time, with Spain also leading Japan by the same scoreline simultaneously. Germany were progressing to the Round of 16 as things stood, However, an inspiring second half comeback from Japan meant that Germany crashed out of the group stage of a World Cup for the second successive time, even if they managed a 4-2 win. Costa Rica's hammering at the hands of Spain meant that they needed two wins out of two to progress to the Round of 16. They did manage to beat table toppers Japan 2-1 in their next game.

A draw would bring goal difference into play to decide who goes through from the group along with Portugal.  Uruguay has made the situation difficult for themselves, having only registered a draw and a defeat so far. They still have a chance to go through if they win and South Korea fail to beat Portugal.

" In the quarter-final of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, Uruguay defeated Ghana in deeply controversial circumstances. The teams played out a 120-minute tie plus penalties and what unfolded during the game laid the groundwork for a fresh international football rivalry. Ghana took the lead on the stroke of half time, through a 40-yard Sulley Muntari thunderbolt, but Diego Forlan levelled the score with a gorgeous free kick just after half-time. So how exactly did Ghana and Uruguay become rivals? GOAL brings you everything you need to know. Why are Uruguay and Ghana rivals in football? Luis Suarez has been cast in the role of chief villain in the Ghana-Uruguay rivalry as, in the closing stages of extra time, after a goalmouth scramble, the Uruguayan striker used both of his hands to block Dominic Adiyah's goal-bound effort. Suarez's deliberate handball prompted an automatic red card and a potentially decisive chance for Ghana in the form of a penalty kick. However, Ghana forward Asamoah Gyan smashed the spot kick off the top of the bar and over. The game subsequently went to penalties and Uruguay emerged as winners, triumphing 4-2 in the shootout. Suarez's behaviour on the pitch, the ultimate rewards for his actions and his conduct in the aftermath incensed the nation of Ghana. Suarez and Uruguay have thus been sticking points for Ghana, so any time they meet, that historic game inevitably casts a shadow. One of the most dramatic #FIFAWorldCup matches we've ever seen üòØHow a handball changed everything for Uruguay and Ghana ‚§µÔ∏è What has been said about the Luis Suarez handball? The Suarez handball is widely considered one of the great sporting injustices perpetrated against Ghana, taking on similar significance as Diego Maradona's infamous 'Hand of God' in the eyes of England supporters, or Thierry Henry's handball for the Republic of Ireland. When asked to recall the events of July 2, 2010, former Ghana defender John Paintsil told the BBC: ""There's no African player who would have done that."" As if to rub salt into the wound, Suarez stopped in the tunnel to watch Ghana's penalty before exiting the pitch and was pictured celebrating with his teammates when Asamoah Gyan missed. The striker later claimed to have ""made the best save of the tournament"", a comment which served to compound the bitterness felt by the Ghana players and their fans. Paintsil said: ""After the penalty was missed you (Suarez) came out and then celebrated like you're on top of the world by hurting people. At least be a professional, feel the pain. Just go to your dressing room and celebrate and then nobody will see it."" On the other hand, Gyan admitted that he would have done the same thing if he was in Suarez's shoes. In an interview with talkSPORT he said: ""I‚Äôm a football player and I do understand the game. Back home, everybody who watched the game, they dislike him. ‚ÄúI always say if I was Suarez I would have done the same thing to save my country. He‚Äôs a hero there. Although people see him as a cheat, he did what he had to do to get his country to the semi-final. ‚ÄúPeople do hate him, but I‚Äôm in the game as well. He did what he had to do to get his country to the semi-final."" Luis Suarez isn't backing down üòà pic.twitter.com/g2DmAJzm8h Did Luis Suarez apologise for his handball vs Ghana? Considering that Suarez appeared to revel in the initial notoriety - claiming that Maradona's hand belonged to him, for example - it is perhaps no surprise that he takes a dim view of the idea that he should have to apologise for the handball.  The former Barcelona and Liverpool star made his feelings on the matter very clear when asked ahead of the last-16 meeting between the teams at the 2022 World Cup. ""I didn't miss the penalty,"" the striker said bluntly when asked about being viewed as 'the devil himself'. ""Maybe if I injured the player I'd apologise, but in this situation I took a red card and the referee gave a penalty. It's not my fault. The player who missed the penalty (Gyan) said he'd do the same. It's not my responsibility to score the penalty"" Indeed, he impressed the idea of moving on, referencing the reconciliation between himself and Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini: ""It's 12 years ago. It's the past. I've played against Chiellini too [who he bit in the 2014 World Cup], and we shook hands."" Which was the best World Cup winning team?

" Even though Spain have always had some of the finest talent around in the game at their disposal, their national team traditionally flattered to deceive. Perennial pre-tournament favourites. Perennial post-tournament underachievers. That all changed in 2008. They won the Euros that year, went on to lift the World Cup two years later, only to then successfully defend their European title in 2012. Their brilliant midfield played a massive role in that successful run, with the likes of Xavi and Andres Iniesta dominating play in the middle, but people often underestimate the attacking talent at hand. David Villa was a prolific goalscorer and so was Fernando Torres in his prime. Those two were by no means Spain's first great attackers, though.  There was Raul. Emilio Butragueno. Alfredo Di Stefano. The list goes on and on. But who is Spain's most lethal attacker ever? Let's take a look at the legends leading their all-time goalscoring charts!",football
" The politician took shots at England and Manchester United centre-back Maguire, saying he scores own goals and assists opponents. Adongo said that the nation's vice president is like an economic version of Maguire.  WHAT THEY SAID: ""Harry Maguire, he's a defender. He was tackling everybody and throwing his body everywhere,"" Adongo said. ""He was seen as the best defender in the world. Manchester United went and bought him. He became the biggest threat at the centre of the Manchester United defence, tackling Manchester players and giving assists to opponents. Mr. Speaker, when you see the opponents go to score, Maguire will score for them."" He added: ""Mr. Speaker, you remember in this country we also have an economic Maguire. We're clapping saying this man is the best in managing foreign terms. The same economic Maguire was at Central University delivering lectures on how to restore the value of the Cedi (Ghana's currency). Mr Speaker why we gave this Maguire the opportunity to be at the centre of our defence? He became the rest of our own goals. Our economic Maguire is taking control of the fundamentals of our economy and destroying all of them.""  THE BIGGER PICTURE: Maguire has been heavily criticised for his performances for club and country. The 29-year-old has lost his place in the United starting XI, having made just four Premier League appearances this season. He has started all three of England's World Cup games, but he was mocked by Iran fans who made banners saying the Three Lions would not win the competition as long as he was in the back-line.

" After starting the campaign with a 1-0 win against Canada, Belgium were beaten by Morocco and needed a win against Croatia to secure a place in the last-16.

WHAT THEY SAID: ‚ÄúThis was my last game as national coach. I said goodbye to the players and staff,"" Martinez said after the game. ‚ÄúToday we were ourselves again. It is never easy to win a match at a World Cup. In that first match against Canada we won, but we weren't ourselves. We deservedly lost the second match against Morocco. We weren't ready.  ""Today we created a lot of chances, so no, I have no regrets. We can leave the World Cup with our heads held high. Of course, elimination in the group stage is not enough for Belgium. We wanted to push through, but every country wants that. This is the best tournament in the world.

" Following the bombshell news that Juventus' entire board had resigned on November 28, it now appears that the plot has thickened, with UEFA announcing that the CFCB First Chamber will open an investigation into the club for potential breaches surrounding Club Licensing and Financial Fair Play regulations. WHAT THEY SAID: A statement published to UEFA's website on December 1 reads: ""The CFCB First Chamber has today opened a formal investigation into Juventus FC for potential breaches of the Club Licensing and Financial Fair Play regulations. ""The CFCB First Chamber investigation will focus on the alleged financial violations that were recently made public as a result of the proceedings led by the Italian Companies and Exchange Commission (CONSOB) and the public prosecutor in Turin."" AND WHAT'S MORE: The statement says a prior settlement with Juventus could be nullified : because that agreement ""was concluded on the basis of the financial information previously submitted by the club pertaining to the financial years closing in 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022."" ""In the event that, after conclusion of this investigation, the club‚Äôs financial situation was significantly different from that assessed by the CFCB First Chamber at the time the settlement agreement was concluded, or if new and substantial facts arise or become known, the CFCB First Chamber reserves the right to terminate the settlement agreement, take any legal step it may deem appropriate, and impose disciplinary measures in accordance with the applicable UEFA CFCB Procedural Rules."" THE BIGGER PICTURE: It emerged that Juve's board of directors stepped down as a result of investigations being opened by Italian authorities into the Old Lady's accounts, specifically payments and wages that were supposedly deferred throughout the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Being investigated by a UEFA body now adds to the club's concerns. IN TWO PHOTOS:  WHAT NEXT FOR JUVENTUS?

" Spain faces Japan in their last group stage match as Luis Enrique's men look to qualify for the round of 16 with a win while Japan needs all three points if they don't want their World Cup dream to come to an end.  Luis Enrique‚Äôs Spain had a scintillating start to their World Cup bashing Costa Rica 7-0 in their opening fixture. But La Furia Roja failed to secure themselves a knockout round ticket after conceding in the last minutes of the game against Germany. The Spanish team would like to repeat their heroics against Costa Rica when they face Japan on Thursday. The fixture against Japan could also serve as the perfect opportunity for Luis Enrique to experiment with his bench strength and rest crucial players. A win would mean Spain will retain the top spot in Group E, but a loss could threaten their chances of qualification if Germany beat Costa Rica by a massive margin. But Spain has registered a win against Asian opponents in their previous 5 encounters a streak they would like to continue. After producing one of the biggest upsets against Germany, the Japanese team was handed a shocking defeat by a more determined Costa Rica team. And now if Hajime Moriyasu's team wants to qualify for the knockout stages of the World Cup for the second successive time, they‚Äôll have to conquer the Spanish challenge. A win would see the Blue Samurais qualify sitting at the pinnacle of the group while a draw would mean they would be dependent on the results from the encounter between Germany and Costa Rica. But if Japan lose against Spain, they would be sent home from the group stage despite their tremendous start to the tournament. Japan XI (3-4-3): Gonda; Itakura, Yoshida, Tanigachi; Ito, Tanaka, Morita, Nagatamo; Kamada, Kubo, Maeda Spain XI (4-3-3): Simon; Azpilicueta, P. Torres, Rodri, Balde; Gavi, Busquets, Pedri; N.

" In a chaotic week involving reported rifts within the squad and just about all the eyes of the footballing world on them, Belgium's performance was chaotic in all the wrong ways. Roberto Martinez's side crashed out of Qatar 2022 having failed to make it out of the group stages following a lifeless draw with Croatia.  And while ahead of kick-off a draw was good enough to advance, they almost fell behind inside the first minute thanks to a swift kick-off routine involving Luka Modric and Ivan Perisic. In part, that told the story of the game; Croatia weren't sharp enough, but Belgium were even worse, and never looked like actually sustaining a consistent threat. The tempo upped somewhat after the break, but considering Morocco were ahead against Canada, it wasn't anywhere near good enough. Romelu Lukaku coming off the bench to miss as many as four glorious opportunities - the first two of which were open nets - painted a dismal picture of Belgium's reality. With each one squandered, elimination looked more and more inevitable. Eden Hazard being given a handful of minutes in the dying embers was truly the last roll of the dice, but was of course not enough to get the Red Devils - currently second in FIFA's world rankings - over the line and into the World Cup knockout stages. GOAL runs through the winners, losers, and player ratings on an admittedly dark hour in Belgium's football history.",football
" TELL ME MORE: It took less than four minutes for Hakim Ziyech to open the scoring as he took advantage of a blunder from Canada's back-line. Youssef En-Nesyri added another goal in the 23rd minute on a fantastic ball from Achraf Hakimi over Canada's back-line, but John Herdman's side pulled one back before half-time thanks to a Nayef Aguerd own goal. Despite Canada's enthusiasm in the second half, the equalising goal never came, although they did come close as a shot bounced near the line before being cleared away. It's Morocco's first last-16 appearance at a World Cup since 1986. THE MVP: A few months ago, Ziyech wasn't even part of this Morocco team, having controversially retired from the international game amid a feud with former coach Vahid Halilhodzic. On Thursday, though, he scored the goal that effectively sent his team to the round of 16, even if it came with a little help from Canada's back-line. THE BIG LOSER: Milan Borjan's catastrophic error helped set the tone within the first four minutes. He wasn't helped out by Alistair Johnston's poor back-pass, but Canada's goalkeeper got a little too cute with his touch, handing Ziyech the first goal.

Croatia had the most incredible run of form in Russia in 2018 as they reached the final, only to lose against pre-tournament France after a thrilling match. This time around too, they have qualified for the Round of 16 by finishing second in the group with 5 points (W1 D2). Former world number one Belgium will probably be the team that disappointed the most as they shockingly failed to get past the group stage, collecting just 4 points. They needed a win in their final group game against Croatia, but could only manage to grab a point after Romelu Lukaku couldn't convert straightforward chances in the second half.

" The event occurred in the second-half of Liverpool's 1-0 victory over City back in mid-October, after Guardiola gestured to fans following Anthony Taylor's decision to overturn a Phil Foden goal due to a foul by Erling Haaland on Fabinho during the build up. When asked about the alleged coin throwing, the Spaniard said in post-match: ''Next time they will do it better, they didn‚Äôt hit me."" THE BIGGER PICTURE: As a result, the Merseyside club conducted an investigation into CCTV footage and witness statements from nearby stewards and fans. While this did find some evidence of coins being thrown, The Athletic have reported that both footage and statements were inconclusive in finding the exact individuals involved, meaning no supporters have been punished. WHAT THEY SAID?: Despite a largely fruitless search into the perpetrators, Anfield officials have reportedly said that they would welcome further witnesses with any more information to come forward. The club had previously condoned what they deemed ""totally unacceptable behaviour"". IN THREE PHOTOS:  WHAT NEXT FOR LIVERPOOL?

" It's not often that a 23-year-old soccer player finds himself at the center of a geopolitical firestorm but, ultimately, there aren't many 23-year-old soccer players quite like Tyler Adams. Ahead of the U.S. men's national team's clash with Iran, Adams was hounded by a reporter about perceived disrespect of the opponent's country. His pronunciation of Iran was corrected before Adams was asked how the U.S. can criticize the political arrest in Iran while African Americans, like Adams, still deal with discrimination stateside. What came next was a moment of grace, humility and maturity. Adams apologized for any offense, going on to discuss his own experiences with discrimination and racism. He pointed to progress and the need to find it no matter what country or culture you represent. He never faltered, showing wisdom in the face of criticism and poise in the face of chaos. In the end, a situation that could have been a nightmare was quickly diffused. That's what Adams does, right? Diffuses bad situations. On the field, off the field, it's simply what he does. And that's why there has not been a bigger presence at this World Cup than Adams, the USMNT youngster that is rapidly becoming a star on and off the pitch. tyler adams gave a classy response after being called out for mispronouncing 'iran' üëè #soccer #usmnt #worldcup #football #tyleradams #usavsiran #fyp  Finally, Adams is getting his flowers from the outside world. A talented young defensive midfielder, he's taken his game to an otherworldly level at this World Cup, undoubtedly the USMNT's best player in Qatar so far. And, off the field, he's taken on the role of captain with elegance, leading from the very front. He's always been one of many leaders on this USMNT and you could say he still is. But, whether it's on that podium or in the middle of the field, Adams has stepped up to become the face of this national team. I don't know whether it's the captaincy or not,"" defender Antonee Robinson said of Adams, ""but I've said to him, since he's come here, he's really upped his level even more than I already know. That energy he brings in midfield and that leadership, it affects all of us and keeps us all in check. He sets the standard."" Often overlooked when compared to his superstar team-mates, there's no doubt that Adams' play at the World Cup has more than earned his spot among them. He leads the World Cup in tackles, with nine in 10 attempts, as has routinely put out any fires faced by the USMNT. It's a key reason the U.S. have yet to allow a goal from open play so far this tournament. Adams, as usual, has been all effort. Data says he's run more than any other player in the tournament so far, covering more ground than seemingly possible. Every time a bad situation has popped up, Adams has been there to handle it, no matter where he has been on the field. Most importantly, though, is that Adams' weaknesses haven't shown at all. We've all known he can tackle and run, but his passing has long been seen as a weak point. Perhaps not anymore. He completed 100 percent of his passes against England, the best team the U.S. has faced thus far. He made 17 line-breaking actions against Iran, helping the U.S. break down a team content to bunker for the first half. The 'American Kante' comparisons are a bit premature but, make no mistake, Adams is playing at that sort of level in Qatar. He, alongside Weston McKennie and Yunus Musah, are dictating how games are played, with the USMNT midfield standing out in each of the three games so far. None have stood out more than Adams, though, despite the fact that he's the one doing the behind-the-scenes dirty work. He was named the USMNT's captain prior to the tournament and, my goodness, did Gregg Berhalter get it right. What more could you ask for from a captain? It's Adams that sets the tone, as many of his team-mates have said. And it's Adams that personifies this team: young, brash and unafraid of whatever is in their path. That is unless the thing in their path is an arachnid! ""England are still a big team at the end of the day,"" he said prior to the match against the Three Lions, ""but the intimidation factor? I wouldn't say there are many things out there that intimidate me, other than spiders!"" It's an attitude that Adams has embodied since the first moment he came into the American public's consciousness. For many, his first real moment in the spotlight actually came in a friendly, as he leapt over John Terry to help a team of New York Red Bulls youth players take down Chelsea in a 2015 friendly. ‚ÄúPlaying with players like Diego Costa, [Eden] Hazard, I‚Äôve seen them in a World Cup,"" a 16-year-old Adams said on that day. ""It‚Äôs an unbelievable feeling stepping on the same field as them. It‚Äôs almost like you don‚Äôt belong, but there‚Äôs a reason you‚Äôre on the field with them."" Then-Red Bulls boss Jesse Marsch echoed those sentiments: ""He‚Äôs specifically a player that is not afraid. We‚Äôve liked him from day one. He was our first young signing and we think he has a really big future.‚Äù That future, ultimately, included that World Cup that Adams has been dreaming about for all of these years. And, just as he made that friendly his moment, he's making this tournament in Qatar his as well. The task will get more difficult now, though. After topping Iran, the U.S. will now look ahead to a clash with the Netherlands in the last 16, putting them against a team that is among the best in the world, even if they haven't quite looked it yet in Qatar. Adams will no doubt be key. He'll likely be used to harass Frenkie de Jong and limit in-form Cody Gakpo, scorer of three goals in as many World Cup games. But if the Adams that showed up in the group stage is still there in the knockouts, the U.S. will like their chances. After the win over Iran, Adams was singled out by Berhalter as the team's standout performer. He was presented with a game ball, not just for his efforts against Iran, but for his heroic efforts throughout the group stage. ""I think this player played very good today,"" Berhalter said, ""but when I look at the body of work over the three games, he's been absolutely crushing it: Tyler Adams."" In the knockout, anything can happen. pic.twitter.com/nwJqbyMZRV He's crushed it in every way imaginable, helping elevate his team and his own profile in the process. There's no doubt that clubs around the world will have been left stunned by Adams, who may not be long for Leeds United if the U.S. can keep this World Cup run-up. That's for the future, though. Next up is the Netherlands, and another chance to write World Cup history. Only one man, Claudio Reyna, has captained the USMNT to a knockout round win, coming all the way back in 2002 when Adams was just three years old. Can the USMNT midfielder be the second? ""It's an opportunity for us,"" Adams said. ""It's gonna be an amazing game. We've obviously played against good competition here like England and the Netherlands could be another favorite to win the World Cup. They've done really well with how they navigated through their group phase of the tournament so far with some amazing players. We're gonna have to be ready for that game."" It'll be tough to bet against the USMNT, even if odds are against them. So far, Adams and co. have stared down every challenge. Wales, England, Iran. World Cup qualifying chaos, general inexperience, rogue press conferences. Adams, though, has shown he won't back down from any of it. Except maybe those damn spiders.

" Forlan has compared the Portugal forward to Philippe Coutinho, who he played with briefly at Inter but who he feels benefitted from his move to Liverpool in 2012. The Uruguayan believes the same could be said for Felix, who could ""increase his performance"" away from Atletico, with United among those being strongly linked with his services. WHAT THEY SAID: ""Joao Felix is a very good player, he is young and has a lot of quality,"" Forlan told reporters after watching Portugal beat Uruguay in the 2022 World Cup group stage. ""They paid a lot of money for him and he has not been playing as expected, but he is still very young. There are reports coming out about the possibility of him leaving Atletico and, if he leaves, he could even increase his performance. I believe in that. It happens a lot. It happened, for example, with Philippe Coutinho, who played very little at Inter and when he went to Liverpool he improved a lot."" THE BIGGER PICTURE: Felix has two goals and three assists to his name in all competitions for Atletico in 2022-23, and he announced himself in Qatar almost immediately. The 23-year-old scored in Portugal's opening day 3-2 victory against Ghana, forming part of Portugal's formidable attack which also includes United playmaker Bruno Fernandes. IN TWO PHOTOS: DID YOU KNOW?

" So ends the era of Tata Martino. It ended on Wednesday night around midnight at Lusail Stadium. And it ended as expected: with Martino showered by boos from a Mexico fanbase that turned on him long ago. He announced his departure soon after. Going forward, that fanbase will endlessly debate the next step. They'll discuss Martino's potential replacement, whether that's Miguel Herrera, Guillermo Almada, Antonio Mohamed or one of the countless other candidates that will be linked to the job. But the fact is that Mexico's national team is in need of fixing. Martino couldn't do it alone; can anyone? Mexico's quest for that fifth game, 'El Quinto Partido', came to a disastrous end on Wednesday. Despite a 2-1 win over Saudi Arabia, El Tri hadn't done enough to overtake Poland, who held onto second spot thanks to goal difference as Group C went right down to the wire. However, Mexico's failure didn't occur on that balmy night in Qatar. It didn't even come during the two games prior, both of which saw El Tri squander chances to add points. No, Mexico's failures have been going on for some time. This wasn't a one-off; it was the latest symptom of an ongoing problem. Martino was no doubt part of that problem. Despite the fanfare that came with his hiring, it was clear that the fanbase had turned on the ex-Barcelona boss. And, in many ways, they had reason to. Of course, El Tri fans are often too harsh on their national team, a program that is not among the elite no matter how much they believe it should be. But there were real reasons to criticize Martino, whose tactics never seemed to work in big games and whose roster selections left many enraged on the road to Qatar. Forget the fact that Carlos Vela and Javier 'Chicharito' Hernandez were left at home, although few Mexico fans will. But you add in Santiago Gimenez and Diego Lainez's absences, two players that could have been part of the national team's future, and you see why frustration would build with Martino. And then there's the loss to Argentina, Martino's home country. He was criticized for his tactics, which saw him park the bus in a big way against Lionel Messi, the man he used to coach for club and country. But most of all he was criticized for his attitude, with many fans believing Martino was nowhere near as heartbroken as they were. As mentioned, though, Martino was just one problem. It all lies deeper than that. Mexico's team, as it stands, is not good enough and, most importantly, not young enough. While young U.S. men's national team and Canada squads lifted their countries into the World Cup, Mexico showed up in Qatar with up to eight players over 30 expected to play key roles. That includes all three strikers - Raul Jimenez, Rogelio Funes Mori and Henry Martin - none of whom performed particularly well in Qatar. ""At least when I played we passed this phase,"" said Mexican legend Cuauhtemoc Blanco, who called for Marcelo Bielsa to be named as Martino's replacement. ""I think they lacked a little more courage and desire in the last play, but that's football."" It all points to a deeper problem: Mexican soccer just isn't allowing its talent to reach the same level of a Chicharito or Vela. The players that are headed to Europe are few and far between. Long gone are the days where Chicharito, Vela, Andres Guardado, Miguel Layun, Hector Moreno and Hector Herrera were playing in top leagues. These days, of the World Cup call-ups, only Guardado, Jimenez, Hirving Lozano, Edson Alvarez and Erick Gutierrez are playing at the top European level, with only two of those players on the right side of 30. There were five players under the age of 24 on Mexico's World Cup squad. Three of them combined to play 17 total minutes. The point is that Mexico isn't exporting talent in the way they used to because Mexican players have become far too valuable to Liga MX teams. As a result, only the elite, players like Jimenez and Lozano, are being sold for their market values with the solid-to-good players being held in Liga MX due to the lack of major transfer fees. That, in many ways, has held El Tri back. Liga MX players have always been a solid foundation of the squad, but never have there been so many in the XI. And never have there been so many on the wrong side of 30 playing key roles for the national team. That's a problem that will, ultimately, fall to Yon de Luisa, the federation president, and Mikel Arriola, the Liga MX chief, to solve. And the World Cup in Qatar is not the only failure of the federation in recent years. Both the men's and women's failed to qualify for the Paris Olympics, while the women also failed to qualify for the World Cup. You can also add in the men's teams failures in the Gold Cup and Nations League for good measure. Both executives have made the federation and national team loads of money and expanded their reach, but both have a lot of work to do to change the direction of the national team program. GROUP C WITH A BOX OFFICE ENDING üçø pic.twitter.com/UfvTLVvDgw That starts with a coach, and though Martino was a problem sure, those two will have many more big decisions to make. Mexico's national team is falling behind, not just their local rivals but the rest of the world. Their experience in Qatar showed how far they'd fallen, with El Tri failing to advance from the group for the first time in eight tournaments. They'll look to right the ship on home soil in 2026, which will come faster than many will expect. We're only three-and-a-half years out from that World Cup, with El Tri suddenly needing to rebuild a national team program on the fly before what should be - and still could be - a defining moment in the country's history. The clock is ticking, and 2026 will be here before you know it. What will El Tri look like by the time it rolls around? Which was the best World Cup winning team?

" The French international is currently leading the goal-scoring charts in the 2022 World Cup with three goals to his name. However, former England international Walcott believes that Mbappe's mettle will be tested if he goes up against Manchester City full-back Walker, who he believes is physically more dominant than the Paris Saint-Germain forward. Walcott also claimed that playing in the Premier League is a completely different ball game than playing in Ligue 1. WHAT THEY SAID: ""I would love to see it. I really would. I feel like Mbappe would struggle against his [Walker‚Äôs] physicality, if I‚Äôm honest,'' The Southampton winger told talkSPORT. ''He plays in the French league, which is a different kettle of fish to the Premier League and Walker has so much experience in the Champions League. So it would be a great test. I think we all want to see it.'' However, he ultimately declined to pick a winner between the two, adding: ""I couldn‚Äôt tell you who would win that ‚Äì because Mbappe is a different beast, he‚Äôs on a different level at the moment.‚Äù THE BIGGER PICTURE: England can potentially face France in the quarter-finals if both nations successfully negotiate their respective challenges in the round of 16. Walker and Mbappe did go up against each other previously in the 2021-22 edition of the Champions League group stage when Manchester City locked horns with PSG. Both teams won their respective home matches with Mbappe scoring at the Etihad Stadium in a 2-1 defeat.  IN THREE PHOTOS:   WHAT NEXT FOR ENGLAND AND FRANCE?

" Switzerland hope to book their place in the knockout stages of the World Cup on Friday when they come up against Serbia. The Swiss started the campaign with a win against Cameroon before going down 1-0 to Brazil and sit second in the table heading into the final group stage match. Serbia vs Switzerland latest odds Serbia are the slight favourites to get the win in this match which would give them a chance of going through to the next round at odds of 13/8 (2.63) with bet365. Switzerland are the outsiders to pick up three points at odds of 9/5 (2.80) while the draw is priced at 9/4 (3.25). Serbia vs Switzerland first goal scorer odds Serbia stars Aleksandar Mitrovic and Dusan Vlahovic are the favourites to open the scoring at 9/2 (5.50) while compatriot Luka Jovic is available at 6/1 (7.00). Haris Seferovic is Switzerland's lowest-priced player to score the first goal of the game at 7/1 (8.00). Serbia vs Switzerland preview Serbia absolutely must win this match to have any chance of going through to the next round of the competition. They have just one point heading into this match, having been bested by Brazil and then surrendered a two-goal lead to draw 3-3 with Cameroon. Serbia will have to cut out the errors in their final match of the group stage to get the win against a difficult opponent in Murat Yakin's team. Switzerland, meanwhile, will progress with a draw as long as Cameroon do not beat Brazil in the other match. Serbia vs Switzerland tips and predictions This should be a tight and nervy affair so don't expect many goals. Backing under 2.5 goals has paid off in all of Switzerland's last three matches so it's worth doing so this time around at odds of 4/5 (1.80). Odds correct at the time of writing.

" Despite being second in FIFA's men's rankings, Belgium currently sit third in Group F of the 2022 World Cup behind Croatia and Morocco. Rifts in the camp have been reported amid off-field tension between Kevin De Bruyne and defender Jan Vertongen, with the Manchester City man claiming his side were ‚Äútoo old‚Äù to win the competition following a laboured 1-0 victory over Canada in their group opener. After defeat to Morocco in their second game, Vertonghen responded by saying: ''Where did it go wrong? We probably also attack badly because we are too old, that must be it now, surely?'' WHAT THEY SAID: Castagne has revealed Belgium players were called to sit down and discuss these tensions, which he refused to label a ""crisis meeting"".  ''I think it was very important for us to have that meeting, but it wasn‚Äôt a crisis meeting as you might have heard from some quarters,'' the Leicester full-back explained in a press conference. ''It was important to get some things off our chest and share our views, but it didn‚Äôt get out of hand. It was important to share how we felt and share our ideas on how we can improve.  ''I don‚Äôt think Kevin meant anything bad. We know that Italy won the Euros with Bonucci and Chiellini at the back, so age isn‚Äôt always a factor. I don‚Äôt think we should be focusing on one or two players who might not have been playing to the best of their ability. We‚Äôre all in it together. We all know we can play better. I don‚Äôt think age is a factor. I just think we played badly.'' THE BIGGER PICTURE: Castagne went on to admit that Belgium need to work on their togetherness in order to show their full potential on the pitch. ''Yes, I think we were united as a group, but perhaps not enough,"" he admitted. ""If you want to go far in the World Cup, you need to be united and you need to be able to fight together with your team-mates. Maybe we weren‚Äôt showing that enough. I think the meeting was helpful in that respect.'' IN THREE PHOTOS:  DID YOU KNOW? Belgium have scored just one goal at the 2022 World Cup, only scoring fewer after two matches at the 1930 edition (0). They had scored eight goals at the same stage in 2018. WHAT NEXT FOR BELGIUM?

" Cameroon face a difficult task of booking a place in the last 16 of the World Cup as they come up against Brazil on Friday. The African side secured a 3-3 draw against Serbia to keep their hopes of progressing to the next round but must beat the group leaders to ensure they go through. Cameroon vs Brazil latest odds Cameroon are big underdogs to get the win in this match at odds of 13/2 (7.50) with bet365. Brazil are the favourites to pick up three points at odds of 2/5 (1.40) while the draw is priced at 15/4 (4.75). Cameroon vs Brazil first goal scorer odds Gabriel Jesus and Guilherme Pedro are the favourites to open the scoring at 15/4 (4.75) while compatriots Vinicius Junior and Richarlison are both available at 11/2 (6.50). Vincent Aboubakar was the hero for Cameroon when he came off the bench to score and assist goals to earn a 3-3 draw against Serbia and he is the African side's lowest-priced player to score the first goal of the game at 17/2 (9.50). Cameroon vs Brazil preview Cameroon are not in the best of form heading into this match. They were bested by Switzerland in their first group stage match before coming back from 3-1 down to earn a valuable point. They have not won any of their last six matches and will have to put an end to that run with a big win against the Selecao. Brazil have not lost since July 2021, going 17 games without defeat. Tite's men have won each of their last nine and will be looking to secure top spot in the group by beating Cameroon on Friday. Cameroon vs Brazil tips and predictions Cameroon have to come out to score against Brazil but the Selecao have considerable firepower, so backing over 2.5 goals at odds of 8/11 (1.73) looks an appealing bet.

" A dressing room video that showed a Mexico jersey on the floor by Messi's feet after their defeat to Argentina sparked outrage from Mexican boxer Canelo, who issued a threat on Twitter saying ""Messi better pray I don‚Äôt find him"". Alvarez has since issued a statement apologising for getting ""carried away"", and Messi denied any wrongdoing after Argentina's latest World Cup win over Poland. WHAT THEY SAID: ""It was a misunderstanding,"" Messi explained. ""Those who know me know that I don't disrespect anyone. These are things that happen in the locker room after the game. I don't have to ask for forgiveness because I didn't disrespect the people of Mexico or the jersey."" THE BIGGER PICTURE: The scenes in the Argentina changing room came after Messi inspired a 2-0 victory over El Tri on matchday two. The Albiceleste ended up finishing top of Group C following a win over Poland by the same scoreline on Wednesday night, capping off a remarkable recovery following their opening defeat to Saudi Arabia.

" James also weighed in on the age-old Lionel Messi vs Cristiano Ronaldo debate, opting for the Portugal captain and snubbing the boy from Rosario. In terms of his most testing adversaries on the pitch, the 22-year-old awarded those titles to Vincius Jr, Rafael Leao and Sadio Mane. WHAT THEY SAID: Regarding his toughest opponents, James wrote ‚Äú3 hardest players I‚Äôve ever played against are all left wingers! Vinicius Jr, [Rafael] Leao and [Sadio] Mane!‚Äù, while on the long-running debate about the world's greatest, the Blues star simply put ""Ronaldo"" in response. THE BIGGER PICTURE: James is currently spending time in rehabilitation following a knee injury suffered in early October which saw him miss England's World Cup campaign. The Blues defender has two goals and two assists in eleven appearances for Chelsea so far this season and was verbal in his disappointment of being snubbed for Qatar.  IN THREE PHOTOS: DID YOU KNOW? James has been directly involved in 16 goals in the Premier League since the start of last season (6 goals, 10 assists), the most of any full-back or wing-back, despite only playing in 33 of Chelsea's 51 games in this period.

" Morocco face Canada at the Al Thumama Stadium on Thursday with their hopes of reaching the 2022 World Cup knockout stages well and truly alive. The final matchday remains extremely tight and barring Canada, all three teams have the possibility to qualify, albeit at the expense of one another.  The equation remains simple for Morocco as they just need a draw to progress. However, if they are defeated things get complicated for Achraf Hakimi and co. In that case, Belgium must lose the other tie against Croatia in order for them to progress, or if Croatia loses, then they must do so by two more goals than Morocco. The Atlas Lions are yet to concede in this World Cup and if they play to their potential then qualification should not be a problem.  On the other hand, Canada will be playing for pride as they have already been knocked out after losing two games against Croatia and Belgium respectively.

" Despite Messi missing from the spot, Alexis Mac Allister and Julian Alvarez sealed a 2-0 victory against Poland on Wednesday that saw Argentina progress to the 2022 World Cup knockout stages as winners of Group C. When Messi took to the pitch he set another record as he became Argentina's most-capped player in the World Cup with 22 appearances, surpassing Maradona. The Paris Saint-Germain forward had a wonderful relationship with Maradona and he believes the late Argentine great would be ''super happy'' with his latest achievement. WHAT THEY SAID: ""I learned it recently, I didn't know it. It's a pleasure to be able to continue to achieve these kinds of records,'' Messi said when quizzed on the record after the Poland win.

" Carlos Valderrama has always been easy to spot. That mop of blonde curly hair makes him one of the most recognisable figures in football. There was a time, though, before streaming, social media and widespread TV coverage, when it was difficult for football fanatics to watch the game's greatest players in action. Consequently, some top talent remained hidden for longer than it should have. Just like Valderrama.  The Colombian had been the best player at the 1997 Copa America and yet was relatively unknown in Europe. That all changed when he graced Wembley the following year.  Valderrama obviously stood out immediately because of his magnificent hair, but what really caught the eye was his wondrous range of passing. The English press were instantly smitten, and were full of praise for the quick thinking of Montpellier president Louis Nicollin, who had shrewdly signed Valderrama before any of Europe's biggest clubs.  ""We had heard there was a great midfielder playing in Colombia so we went down to take a look for ourselves,"" Nicollin told FIFA's official website. ""Then, we went to see him play for Colombia at Wembley in May 1988. We agreed terms with his club and Valderrama signed on right away.  ""He played like a dream in London and the following day all the English papers ran stories entitled 'Lucky Montpellier'."" Valderrama initially struggled to adapt to the more physical Ligue 1, and it didn't help that he wasn't the most industrious of midfielders. However, by the time the 1990 World Cup rolled around, he was playing the best football of his spell in Europe, having just inspired Montpellier to a Coupe de France triumph.  ""In the fast and furious European game he wasn‚Äôt always at his ease,"" former team-mate Laurent Blanc explained. ""He was a natural exponent of 'toque', keeping the ball moving.  ""But he was so gifted that we could give him the ball when we didn‚Äôt know what else to do with it knowing he wouldn‚Äôt lose it... and often he would do things that most of us only dream about!"" Valderrama underlined that fact at Italia '90, the tournament which made him a global icon.  He was never the most prolific of goalscorers but he helped Colombia kick off their campaign with a sweet strike in a 2-0 win over UAE in Bologna. Defeat against Yugoslavia put the team in an awkward position, needing at least a point against eventual winners West Germany in their final group fixture to progress. They looked doomed, then, when Pierre Littbarski broke the deadlock with just over two minutes of normal time remaining at San Siro. However, Valderrama intervened, and in sensational fashion, skipping past a couple of players before teeing up Freddy Rincon for a last-gasp equaliser that sent Colombia through to the last 16. Unfortunately, they would prove authors of their own downfall against Cameroon, with Rene Higuita making one of the most infamous errors in World Cup history, gifting Roger Milla the crucial opening goal in a 2-1 defeat in Naples after embarking upon an ill-advised dribble outside of his area in extra time. Back home, though, the fans were immensely proud of the national team's performances in what was only their second appearance at the finals ‚Äì and after a 28-year gap too. The reaction to the team's elimination from USA 94, though, was as shocking as it was tragic, with Andres Escobar shot dead shortly after returning home. The defender had scored the own goal which had effectively knocked Colombia out of a tournament many had tipped them to win, and was the reported motive for his murder.  Valderrama, just like the rest of his team-mates, was devastated by Escobar's death. ""It's still very difficult for me to talk about him,"" he told the St. Petersburg Times seven years later. ""It's very painful.  ""He was very close to me. We were very good friends, very good friends. That was my worst experience playing the sport."" Valderrama would go on to appear in a third World Cup, in 1998, but he was 37 at that stage and proved unable to prevent a weaker Colombia side from suffering another first-round exit. ""Naturally, I would have liked to have been world champion, but I don't regret the fact I wasn't,"" Valderrama later told FIFA.  ""You should only worry when you never get the chance to reach certain goals, and the fact is my team-mates and I had that chance, not just once but three times.  ""The World Cup is so tough that the best team we ever had, the one that went to USA 94, didn't even get past the group phase. We just didn't have it in us to win it.  ""Sport has been very good to me, though. I'll always remember those great moments we had with the national squad."" Football fans will always remember Valderrama, too, of course.

" Kevin De Bruyne was named Man of the Match in Belgium's highly fortuitous win over Canada. It was a farcical fan vote. And he was the first to admit it. ""I don't think I played a great game,"" a bemused De Bruyne told reporters. ""I don't know why I got the trophy."" And that's the thing about De Bruyne. He's honest. Maybe to a fault.  It's been evident for some time now that Belgium are a fading force. The feeling is that the 'Golden Generation' has lost its lustre. So, the last thing Roberto Martinez needed was for his best player to add his voice to the chorus of critics. In an interview with The Guardian last Saturday, De Bruyne was asked if Belgium could win the World Cup. His response? ""No chance, we're too old."" It got worse. ""I think our chance was 2018,"" he confessed. ""We have a good team, but it is ageing. We lost some key players. We have some good new players coming, but they are not at the level other players were in 2018. I see us more as outsiders."" In an era in which so few footballers say anything remotely interesting, De Bruyne should be commended for his frankness. However, his comments, which came just a day before Belgium's shock 2-0 loss to Morocco, clearly didn't go over well with his team-mates.  Speaking immediately after the game, veteran defender Jan Vertonghen sarcastically stated, ""I guess we attack badly because we are also too old up front..."" Martinez did his best to defuse the bomb that De Bruyne had dropped on the squad, arguing that sometimes comments are taken out of context. He even tried to argue that maybe it was a clever attempt to play down Belgium's chances. If it was a ""double bluff"", it backfired badly. Rather than lull Morocco into a false sense of security, it instead left Belgium looking like a squad in a state of disarray.  RTL even claimed that there had been an altercation between De Bruyne, Vertonghen and EdenHazard,  who had also labelled the Belgian backline ""not the fastest"". Romelu Lukaku supposedly had to break it up. Thibaut Courtois was quick to dismiss the veracity of the report, though, labelling it ""lies"". ""A situation was described [in that report] that doesn't exist,"" the goalkeeper insisted. ""As a group, we need to avoid that negativity. Everything was clarified. Everyone has openly expressed their opinion. It's good that we had a group conversation. We said what we thought to each other. We have to be honest with each other and fight for each other on the pitch."" Interestingly, Martinez doesn't believe that his players have been guilty of a lack of effort, instead pointing to a bizarre lack of confidence in possession. ""I thought we played [against Morocco] with the fear of losing,"" he said. ""Without the ball, we still work for each other, but when we have the ball, we don't stand out, we are not ourselves."" De Bruyne is the most glaring, and concerning, case in point.  He looks nothing like the player that has made the Premier League his playground over the past few years. He has no goals, no assists and just two successful dribbles to his name, while his pass accuracy is 71.43 percent.  There was disbelief in the stands during the Canada game when De Bruyne butchered a brilliant breakaway that he himself had sparked by failing to spot the supporting Youri Tielemans completely unmarked to his right, while he latter suffered the ignominy of being nutmegged by Stephen Eustaquio, which drew one of the loudest cheers of the night. De Bruyne fared even worse against Morocco, creating just one chance, losing the ball a whopping 28 times and having zero touches in the opposition area.  A colossal improvement is required if Belgium are to have any chance of beating Croatia in their final fixture to seal a place in the last 16.  Martinez has tried to alleviate the pressure on De Bruyne by pointing out that it‚Äôs not just the City star who is struggling in Qatar. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve not seen the best Belgium,‚Äù he argued. But we‚Äôre unlikely to see the best Belgium if we don‚Äôt see the best De Bruyne.  Furthermore, while the 31-year-old has more pressing concerns right now, it‚Äôs difficult not to ponder De Bruyne‚Äôs place in the pantheon of the game‚Äôs greatest players.  His status as a Premier League legend is beyond dispute. But he has yet to win a major European honour at club level, or a major trophy triumph with the most talented Belgium side of all time. For example, on Thursday, he will go up against Luka Modric. Exceptionally gifted as De Bruyne obviously is, would anyone really put him in the same bracket as a midfield mastermind that has been utterly integral to five Champions League triumphs at club level, as well as Croatia's run to the final of the 2018 World Cup? Even Vincent Kompany admitted before the tournament began that he feared his former team-mate might never claim the Ballon d‚ÄôOr award that he feels his talent so richly deserves. ""If I was Kevin ‚Äì or any player hoping to win it ‚Äì I would get in there now. He needs to win it before [Erling] Haaland and [Kylian] Mbappe start,"" the Burnley boss quite correctly pointed out. ""Because, for the next 15 years, it could be another Messi-Ronaldo scenario. The next couple of years is definitely the moment for Kevin to get involved and try to win it.

De Bruyne has obviously yet to make his mark in Qatar, but there is still time. The Croatia clash will decide Belgium's fate, and arguably De Bruyne's World Cup legacy.

" Gareth Southgate could not have asked for much more when England took on Wales on Tuesday. The England manager was under pressure following a disappointing 0-0 draw with the United States, with many pointing the finger at his tactics and team selection. So he needed a good performance and that‚Äôs exactly what he got, with England cruising to a 3-0 win which saw them top their group and set up a last-16 clash with Senegal on Sunday. Southgate shuffled his pack slightly and his changes worked perfectly, with Marcus Rashford and Phil Foden - who were both handed their first starts of the tournament - sharing the goals between them. But that leaves the England manager facing some difficult decisions when it comes to selecting his side to face Senegal. GOAL, takes a look at some of the issues Southgate must decide on...",football
" Messi was bailed out after seeing his penalty saved by Szczesny as goals from Alexis Mac Allister and Julian Alvarez propelled Argentina to a 2-0 victory over Poland and seal the top spot in Group C. There was much controversy around the first-half penalty decision as it was deemed that Szczesny caught Messi in the face with his arm while grabbing an aerial ball. The keeper was so confident that referee Danny Makkelie would not point to the spot after checking VAR that he went ahead and placed a ‚Ç¨100 bet with Messi. However, Szczesny lost the bet as Makkelie gave the penalty, and he has jokingly admitted that he is now expecting to be punished. WHAT THEY SAID: ""We spoke before the penalty and I told would bet him ‚Ç¨100 that he [referee] wasn't going to give it,"" Szczesny told TV2.  ""So I've lost a bet against Messi. I don't know if that's allowed at the World Cup -- I'm probably going to get banned for it! But I don't care right now. I'm not going to pay him either -- he doesn't care about ‚Ç¨100 I think he has enough.'' THE BIGGER PICTURE: The Juventus keeper has been in fine form in this World Cup and is now up to two penalty saves, having also denied Saudi Arabia's Salem Al-Dawsari from 12 yards on matchday two. Ultimately, his save against Messi turned out to be crucial for Poland in the goal-difference battle with Mexico as they also progressed to the last 16. ""I was fortunate twice this competition,"" he told RAI Sport. ""It's a great moment in the career of a player, the World Cup is the maximum and this is special. There's a bit of work that goes into it, too, but in order to save a Messi penalty, you need some luck as well."" IN THREE PHOTOS:   WHAT NEXT FOR SZCZESNY?

" This year‚Äôs GOAL50 is full of some classic clashes between the world‚Äôs finest players, but we need GOAL readers to cast your votes to decide who deserves to finish on top. Two outside contenders for GOAL50 are Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden, with both young midfielders sure to be popular picks among voters. The two sensational talents have the potential to be the future of England‚Äôs midfield‚Äîsome would argue they already ought to represent the present‚Äîbut will either of them get their hands on GOAL50 this year? This is the second time Foden has made the shortlist, having made the cut in 2021 on the back of magnificent year when he won the Young Player of the Season award and impressed at the European Championship. Since then, he's gone from strength to strength; he made 28 appearances as Manchester City again won the title last term, and is firmly on course to register his career best goal returns this term. Already this season, the 22-year-old has had a hand in 10 league goals‚Äîonly four fewer than in the whole of last term‚Äîand even netted a hat-trick in October‚Äôs 6-3 rout of Manchester United. Foden may be a generational talent, but he‚Äôs currently being eclipsed in the England team by Borussia Dortmund‚Äôs Bellingham, who may also pip the Manchester City man in GOAL50. Despite his slender years, the 19-year-old already looks accomplished at the highest levels of world football, having excelled in the Champions League and the Bundesliga. His form has prompted transfer rumours linking him with a move to Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United, although for now he‚Äôs focused on England‚Äôs World Cup bid‚Äîhaving already opened his international account against Iran in the Three Lions‚Äô opener. The wonderkid‚Äôs individual qualities‚Äîhis dynamism, technique, intelligence‚Äîset him apart as a future England great, while his maturity has already prompted talk that he could be a long-term captain of the national side.

" With Argentina piling on the pressure in their final group game against Poland, they were awarded a penalty in controversial circumstances during the first half. VAR adjudged Szczesny to have fouled Messi by making contact when coming for a cross, but he saved the resulting spot-kick in tremendous fashion to deny the seven-time Ballon d'Or winner. WHAT HE SAID: Speaking after the match to TVP, the Juventus stopper explained his point of view on the incident: ""I immediately told the referee that I touched him (Messi) with my hand in the face, but I only hit him on the side of his face. I told him there was contact but I don't think there is a penalty. The referee decided otherwise and that's fine - I got to show off. ""Now I can say that I knew where Messi would shoot, but at the time I wasn't so sure. Leo looks at the keeper on some penalties and hits hard on others,"" he added. ""I knew that if he was going to hit hard, it would be more to my left. I saw that he was not stopping, so I went, I sensed, I defended. I'm happy because that penalty gave something in the end. Very big satisfaction. I owed it to the team."" THE BIGGER PICTURE:Astoundingly, his fine effort to paw away Messi's spot kick means Szczesny has now already saved two penalties at the 2022 World Cup. And while it wasn't enough to inspire Poland to victory on the night, it proved crucial in ensuring they made it out of Group C and into the last 16. IN THREE PHOTOS: WHAT NEXT FOR POLAND?

" Martino told reporters his tenure ended the second the final whistle blew on Wednesday. With his exit, a hire that at first inspired hope in 2019, finished in failure. WHY WAS MARTINO LET GO? The Argentine coach had become unpopular long before the World Cup, with losses to the United States in the Nations League and Gold Cup finals in the summer of 2021 turning his spell with El Tri toxic. Mexico decided not to make a change late in the qualifying cycle, but their continued trust in Martino didn't pan out, as the team's attack looked hopeless until it was too late in Qatar. AND WHAT'S MORE: Martino's unpopularity and his at times combative public persona led to reports that he would have left his post even if Mexico made a deep run in the tournament. All parties were ready to move on from a partnership that never worked. STORY IN TWO PHOTOS: WHAT'S NEXT FOR MEXICO? They must do a thorough analysis of what went wrong at the 2022 World Cup.

" WHAT'S HAPPENING? The French football association will submit a complaint to FIFA after Griezmann's late equaliser vs Tunisia was controversially chalked off for offside in the dying embers of the game, securing the underdogs a shock 1-0 victory. THE BIGGER PICTURE: France fell behind just before the hour mark thanks to Wahbi Khazri's effort, but got back on level terms in the eighth minute of injury time when the Atletico Madrid forward was first to pounce on a poor clearance and smashed home an equaliser. However, VAR intervened and ruled he had been offside in the build-up, thus disallowing the goal, even though Griezmann had picked up the ball after it had come off a Tunisian defender. AND WHAT'S MORE: Following the incident, the French Football Federation (FFF) said: ""We are writing a complaint following Antoine Griezmann's goal, which we believe was wrongly disallowed.

" Messi shared his thoughts after Argentina's 2-0 win over Poland at the World Cup. The captain missed a penalty in the first half, setting an unwanted record in the process, but saw team-mates  Alexis Mac Allister and Julian Alvarez score to fire Lionel Scaloni's side into the knockout stages as group winners. WHAT THEY SAID: ""I‚Äôm angry for having missed the penalty, but the team came out stronger after my mistake. We knew that once the first goal went in, it would change the game and they would open up,"" he told reporters. ""The previous game gave us a lot of peace of mind and we went out onto the field thinking we had to win.""AND WHAT'S MORE: Messi also spoke about his team's chances after safely making it through to the last 16 as group winners. ""The match against Australia is going to be very difficult. Anyone beats anyone, everything is very even,"" he added. ""We have to prepare the game in the best way as we always do.We must be calm and go game by game. Now another World Cup begins and hopefully we can continue to maintain what we did today.""

" Hirving Lozano sat glum and alone in the dugout when the match ended, a training bib draped over his head. Cesar Montes rested on his back in the middle of the pitch, hands covering his eyes. Edson Alvarez wept in a post-match TV interview. Heartbreak. Complete and utter heartbreak. Mexico would have felt deep pain regardless of the elimination method, but this particular way of going out of the World Cup felt extra cruel. After squandering each and every chance given to them in the first two games of the group stage, El Tri finally threatened in the attack. They scored twice in the second half to inspire hope, but couldn't get the third that would have given them a tiebreaker advantage over Poland in Group C. A 2-1 win over Saudi Arabia that exhilarated their fans most of the way was ultimately irrelevant. Manager Gerardo ""Tata"" Martino's tenure is likely over, and it will be seen as a failure. Despite the fight back, despite the hope, the 2022 World Cup was a grand disappointment for El Tri, who expected to be around a lot longer than this.  This is their first group stage exit since 1978.

" With France already having secured their place in the last 16 of the World Cup ahead of matchday three in Group D, head coach Deschamps used their game against Tunisia as a rare chance to rest and rotate his squad. They fell to a shock defeat, though, with Wahbi Khazri's goal the difference. WHAT HE SAID: Speaking to RMC after the match, Deschamps delivered his assessment: ""We had some difficulties through the choices that I made. It should help us in four days. Some players were at risk [of injury] and we had just played two high-intensity matches. It allowed the substitutes to see the difference [in quality] in a World Cup match."" He added: ""We‚Äôve reached the objective, we‚Äôre going to recover, now begins a second competition."" THE BIGGER PICTURE: A 1-0 win for Tunisia wasn't enough to secure them their place in the knockouts and instead sees them eliminated, due to Australia eking out a 1-0 victory of their own against Denmark elsewhere in the group. However, they can head home proud of their work, having beaten the defending champions. France, meanwhile, can be content with the fact they have rested key players ahead of the last 16.

Mexico left it too late for any hope of getting through to the knockout stages and will particularly rue the chances they didn't take in their final game.

 England announced on Thursday that White has left the Three Lions' World Cup squad for personal reasons and is unlikely to return before the conclusion of the tournament. White's departure means manager Gareth Southgate is reduced to 25 players for the rest of the World Cup. #ThreeLions defender @ben6white has left England‚Äôs training base in Al Wakrah and returned home for personal reasons. WHY CAN'T ENGLAND REPLACE WHITE? All World Cup squads had to be submitted to FIFA by November 13.

But, he's since apologised for his outburst. WHAT HE SAID: Canelo took to Twitter to issue the apology: ""These last few days I got carried away by the passion and love I feel for my country and made comments that were out of place for which I want to apologize to Messi and the people of Argentina. Every day we learn something new and this time it was my turn. ""I wish both teams much success in their matches today and here we will continue supporting Mexico until the end."" THE BIGGER PICTURE: After Messi had fired Argentina into the lead with a spectacular finish from distance, he was caught on camera in the dressing room at full-time seemingly kicking a Mexican shirt that had been swapped after the game. That enraged Canelo, who stated that Messi 'better pray to God that (he) didn‚Äôt find him'. IN TWO PHOTOS:  WHAT NEXT FOR MESSI?

" Pochettino has been a regular pundit in Qatar for the BBC so far at the 2022 World Cup. He's been out of work in a managerial capacity since he was dismissed by Paris Saint-Germain in July of this year. And having spent time covering international football as a pundit, he's now open to the idea of managing on the international stage. WHAT HE SAID: Speaking to Sky Sports, Pochettino explained: ""It wasn't under my consideration to go (into international management) but now, yes I am open. Why not? ""Yes, of course we are still young, full of energy, and day-by-day I like the adrenaline to train, to be involved,"" he added: ""Maybe the national team is a different job, but why not?

VAR's decision to disallow Griezmann's goal did raise eyebrows and certainly did not impress the defending champions. The Frenchman was offside when the ball was originally played in but moved back into an onside position. Tunisia defender Montassar Talbi then headed the ball into the air, and Griezmann reacted smartly to volley the ball home. It appears the forward was deemed to be interfering with play despite the action occurring in the second phase. STORY IN TWO PHOTOS: WHAT NEXT?

" A chaotic 48 hours in Turin has seen Juve's entire board of directors resign amid allegations of balance sheet irregularities and supposed private agreements between the club and players. Juventus have since denied these allegations, stating that any sporting sanction would be ""unfounded"" without accounting alterations. WHAT THEY SAID: ""The accounting treatment adopted in the contested financial statements falls within those allowed by the applicable accounting standards,"" a club statement read. ""The Public Prosecutor's allegations do not appear to be well-founded and, moreover, do not appear to be in line with the findings contained in the Consob resolution of 19 October 2022 in terms of either assumptions or conclusions."" THE BIGGER PICTURE: Juve's official statement comes on the same day that former president Andrea Agnelli came out in support of the club, which he claimed is ""greater than any man"". With Agnelli gone, the Turin club revealed that their new board of directors will be chaired by auditing expert and ex-corporate executive Gianlucia Ferrero, arguing that Juventus ""has the ability to become an even more valuable company than it is today"".

" Saudi Arabia surprised the world with an amazing comeback victory against tournament favourites Argentina, however, their happiness was short-lived as they succumbed to a defeat to Poland in the next game. Mexico were labelled by many as certified runners-up in Group C but haven't won a game in this World Cup. Both teams could still book a place in the knockout stages but will have to overcome many hurdles. If Saudi Arabia were to qualify it would be the second time in their history that they made it past the group stages. They last played beyond the first round of games in 1994 and would be hoping to make a deep run than they did back then. However, it won't be such an easy task. Mexico are unbeaten in all games against Mexico, having won thrice and drawn once. The fact that Saudi Arabia have only kept one cleansheet in their last eighteen World Cup games would make them more optimistic about securing all three points once again. However, their own record in the tournament isn't that great recently, with the Mexicans on a winless run of 4 matches. They can't take anything for granted. Saudi Arabia vs Mexico confirmed lineups Saudi Arabia XI (4-1-4-1): Al-Owais; Al-Tambakti, Al-Bulaihi, Al-Amri, Abdulhamid; Al-Hassan; Al-Dawsari, Kanno, Al-Ghanam, Al-Buraikan; Al-Shehri. Mexico XI (4-3-3): Ochoa; Gallardo, Moreno, Montes, Sanchez; Chavez, Alvarez, Pineda; Vega, Lozano, Martin Saudi Arabia vs Mexico LIVE updates Mexico's upcoming fixtures If Mexico were to qualify they are likely to do so as runners-up of Group C.

" Argentina and Poland cross swords in their last fixtures in Group-C as both teams would be looking for three points to qualify for the next round. A win would see either outfits go through while if they dro points they would be dependent on the result of the game between Mexico and Saudi Arabia to decide their fate. For Lionel Messi, it‚Äôs his one last chance to lift the biggest prize in football and a loss against Poland could send him home packing. The PSG forward was influential in guiding his international side to victory against Mexico and once again all eyes will be on the 35-year-old legend from Rosario. A win against Poland would see La Albiceleste march into the knockout stages while they could be in danger of going home if they drop points. Another factor for Lionel Scaloni‚Äôs men is the quality of opposition they would face if they win against Poland. If Argentina finish at the summit of Group-C, they would lock horns with Australia, but if they qualify from second position they would face France in the Round-of-16. Like Argentina, Poland will be dependent on their talismanic striker Robert Lewandowski to guide them through to the knockout phase. After missing a penalty in the opening fixture against Mexico, the Barcelona forward bagged his maiden World Cup goal to secure his team three points against Saudi Arabia. Once again, Lewandowski would be looking to find the back of the net and produce another upset and finish at the top of the group. The Eagles have looked solid in defense and are yet to concede a goal in this edition of the World Cup but keeping the likes of Messi, Di Maria, and Martinez at bay could prove challenging. Poland have conceded a goal in the 11 previous meetings against Argentina, and the Eagles will look to rectify their record while the team in blue and white would look to increase their goal scoring streak. Poland XI (4-4-1-1): Szczesny; Bereszynski, Glik, Kiwior, Cash; Frankowski, Bielik, Krychowiak, Zielinski; Swiderski; Lewandowski Argentina XI (4-3-3): Mart√≠nez; Molina, Romero, Otamendi, Acu√±a; De Paul, Enzo Fern√°ndez, Mac Allister; Messi, √Ålvarez, Di Mar√≠a  If Argentina win, they would finish at the pinnacle of the group and face Australia in the round of 16. If Lionel Scaloni's men finish second in the group they'll face France in the round of 16.  For Poland, a win or a draw would see them qualify for the next round. If they finish at the top of the group they'll face Australia and if they qualify on the second position they would lock horns with France.  Which was the best World Cup winning team?

" The Athletic reports that FIFA is considering a huge change to the rules for the 2026 World Cup. The change would see teams compete in a penalty shootout if they draw a group stage game, with a potential extra point up for grabs for the winners. THE BIGGER PICTURE: 2026 will be the first year the World Cup expands from a 32 team tournament to 48 teams, meaning a mammoth round will take place after the group stages. While not yet confirmed, 16 three-team groups look set to be established instead of the usual eight groups of four, with the top two from each group qualifying for a round of 32 knockout stage. AND WHAT'S MORE: In order to combat potential collusion that could come with staging penalty shootouts after games, FIFA is considering the idea of them taking place before games as a result. FIFA have had to combat this before, with the final matchday of World Cup group stages kicking off at exactly the same day and time since 1986, in order to avoid any foul play. IN TWO PHOTOS:  WHAT NEXT FOR THE WORLD CUP?

His advanced abilities for his age have prompted Vasco to demand a club-record fee for the player - the previous highest mark was ‚Ç¨18.5 million paid by Bayer Leverkusen for Paulinho in 2018. THE BIGGER PICTURE: It's understood that a clause in Santos' contract states that any English team can pay below his ‚Ç¨40 million release clause to secure his services, though the exact figure is not known. That clause is a boost to Chelsea and Newcastle as they try to negotiate a lower fee. AND WHAT'S MORE: Santos recently renewed his contract with Vasco, signing on until September 2027 with the Rio de Janeiro club.

" The most bittersweet of victories for Tunisia and relief for France. The Africans pulled off one of the biggest upsets in World Cup history by defeating the reigning champions at a raucous Education City Stadium thanks to Wahbi Khazri's second-half strike. But their famous victory proved in vain, as Australia progressed to the last 16 instead of them thanks to a 1-0 defeat of Denmark. France are also through, of course, and as winners of Group D, but Didier Deschamps' lack of strength in reserve was exposed on a night where he had to bring on his big guns to try salvage the game. GOAL runs through all of the winners from a wild evening in Doha...",football
" TELL ME MORE: Australia sealed second place in Group D at the World Cup 2022 by beating Denmark thanks to a second-half goal from Leckie. The Danes had the better of the first half but had few sights of goal and went in at the break without managing to find a breakthrough. Australia made a change at half-time, replacing Craig Goodwin with Keanu Baccus, and were much improved in the second 45 minutes.  As news filtered through the stadium that Tunisia had taken a shock lead against France in the group's other game, which meant Australia had to win, the Socceroos hit Denmark on a quick break, with Leckie scoring a fine goal to seal a vital three points. THE MVP: Australia's Leckie will take all the headlines after scoring a brilliant winner on the hour mark. The forward showed great pace and timed his run well to latch onto a through ball. Leckie then turned Joakim Maehle inside out before dispatching a low shot across goal and past the despairing dive of goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel. It's Leckie's 14th goal for the national team and one of his most important too, guaranteeing the Socceroos a place in the knockout stages. THE BIG LOSER: Denmark needed to beat Australia to progress but drew a blank in a flimsy display. The Danes needed their attackers to show their worth but there was very little quality on offer up front. Andreas Skov Olsen had one shot saved and that was about as good as it got from the striker. It was no surprise to see him replaced on 70 minutes after an utterly toothless outing. Skov Olsen wasn't the only Denmark player to disappoint by any means but this was a game where his team needed goals and he simply never looked like scoring.

France were able to secure qualification to the next round within the first two games, becoming the first team to do so in the tournament. However, they almost lost the top spot with a shock loss to Tunisia. Australia surprised everyone with their performances against Denmark and Tunisia after their crushing defeat to France in the opening game, to finish as runners-up. Tunisia sadly failed to qualify for the Round of 16 despite beating France in their last match, however, they will go home with their heads held high. Denmarks were considered by many to be the surprise package of the tournament, having shown excellent form beforehand. However, they didn't replicate their earlier performances and leave the World Cup winless.",football

" Belgium's lacklustre start to the World Cup had led to reports of a dressing room bust up between Eden Hazard, Kevin De Bruyne and Jan Vertonghen. However, the players have since come out denying these rumours, and their words were echoed by their manager during his press conference previewing the Red Devils' must-win match against Croatia on Thursday. WHAT THEY SAID: ""There are media that like to jump on fake and negative stories instead of supporting the most talented team in the history of Belgian football,"" Mart√≠nez told reporters. ""I don't know where those stories come from or who brings them out. But that person scored an own goal for Belgium instead of supporting his country. We are here in Qatar to achieve our goal.

" After it was announced on November 28 that the entire Juventus board had resigned, former club president Andrea Agnelli has spoken for the first time since the shocking news, in support of the Old Lady. WHAT HE SAID: Quoted by Gianluca Di Marzio, Agnelli spoke positively about Juve in a statement: ""Juventus is greater than any man who will ever be able to lead it . (It was) a choice made in mutual agreement with John Elkann (CEO of the club's holding company Exor). ""I remain the leading fan and nothing changes for the team's programs and objectives: they are up to the situation, they can win anything. I already said in 2019 that this is a system that needed to be regulated from within and that needs to be changed."" THE BIGGER PICTURE: Agnelli served as chairman for Juventus from 2010 until his 2022 departure, which came about as a result of an investigation into the club's concerning accounts, which began as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. IN TWO PHOTOS:  WHAT NEXT FOR JUVENTUS? It remains to be seen who will take over on the board of directors at Juve, as the club descends into chaos once again away from the pitch.

" Stam was also critical of Jadon Sancho as he pointed towards United needing to have strength in depth up top if they are to compete at the highest level. The former centre-back praised Antony's goal contributions immediately after joining the club but feels the winger can do more.

""Marcus Rashford is doing very well, Antony has come in and has scored a couple of goals but I think he needs to step up because he‚Äôs not performing to the standard I know he can. ""To be consistent, Man Utd need forwards who are performing in almost every game and that‚Äôs why you need to have options because if someone isn‚Äôt performing, then you‚Äôre able to bring someone else in who can."" THE BIGGER PICTURE: Given their selection of underperforming forwards, United have been linked with PSV Eindhoven's Cody Gakpo since the summer window, with the 23-year-old taking the World Cup by storm and currently sitting joint-first in the tournament's goalscoring charts. However, Stam is on the fence about United signing his fellow countryman. ""Everyone is talking about Cody Gakpo, people are going to assume that Man Utd are going to go for him but I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs the situation,"" Stam continued. ""Gakpo would be a player that would fit into the Man Utd squad.

" Neville, who made 603 appearances for Man Utd spanning 19 seasons, recognised the pressure associated with playing for one of England's greatest football clubs. The former full-back pointed towards the backing from Gareth Southgate and overall positive mood around camp as main factors in Maguire's improved form, after he has struggled for game time under new United boss Erik ten Hag. WHAT THEY SAID: ""I think he feels loved more by England maybe, I think he feels more at home,"" Neville explained to Sky Sports. ""Harry Maguire plays better for his country than his club. I think there are a few players who feel that way, Raheem Sterling. They have a good group, a manager who believes in them, who has selected them regularly.  ""Harry is a great centre-back and he has been brilliant in the last two tournaments, he has just had an awful time at United these last 12 months. United is a very unforgiving place, I know that from being there for 20 years, if you just do not get it right that place can just eat you alive - Harry is just getting that at this moment in time."" THE BIGGER PICTURE: Maguire has impressed in Qatar after starting all three of England's group games, partnered each time alongside John Stones as part of a back four. While this formula has been tried and tested in previous tournaments, Southgate raised a few eyebrows when he elected the pairing given Maguire's struggles at club level. So far, though, it has paid off with England conceding just two goals as they progressed as Group B winners. IN TWO PHOTOS: DID YOU KNOW? Maguire made as many touches in the opposition penalty area in the first half against Wales as Gareth Bale made all tournament (2). WHAT NEXT FOR MAGUIRE?

" Pele was taken into the Albert Einstein hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil by his wife Marcia Aoki and a caregiver on Tuesday, according to ESPN Brazil. They state that he arrived unscheduled as a result of swelling all over his body, unlike previous, scheduled visits. The 82-year-old has been in and out of hospital with increasing regularity in recent years. He underwent surgery to remove a tumour on his colon in September 2021 and spent a period in intensive care, but has been undergoing chemotherapy in the time since. ESPN's report states that medical staff identified 'decompensated heart failure' when attempting to diagnose Pele's swelling, with the legend arriving 'restless and confused'. It is also said he now struggles to feed himself. Further tests are being carried out on November 30 to properly assess his condition, with no indication of a potential discharge. They hope to identify the organs compromised by the cancer in their testing, with his body not responding to chemotherapy. Pele's daughter, Kelly Nascimento, took to Instagram to provide an update on her father's condition on November 30. She captioned her post with: ""Hi my friends. Lots of alarm in the media today concerning my dad‚Äôs health. He is in the hospital regulating medication. Some of my siblings are visiting Brazil. There is now emergency or new dire prediction.

" France don't have much to play for after confirming their place in the knockout stages with a hard-fought win against Denmark. However, for Tunisia, there is everything to play for. The African side could still end up qualifying, although it would require the Herculean task of beating the 2018 World Cup winners and hoping Denmark don't lose to Australia. The curse of previous World Cup winners getting knocked out from the tournament since 2010 was finally broken by France when they beat Denmark 2-1. With the top spot also essentially sealed, spectators may see a heavily rotated French side with important players (perhaps including Kylian Mbappe) being given a rest. Tunisia will be aiming to make history by making it past the group stage for the first time in their history. However, despite 27 shots in both games so far, they are yet to score in this edition of the World Cup. To beat a defensively astute France, the African side will have to be at their A-game. Tunisia vs France confirmed lineups Tunisia XI (5-4-1): Dahmen; Kechrida, Talbi, Meriah, Ghandri, Maaloul; Skhiri, La√Ødouni, B. Romdhane, B. Slimane; Khazri. France XI (4-3-3): Mandanda; Disasi, Konat√©, Varane, Camavinga; Fofana, Tchouam√©ni, Veretout; Coman, Kolo Muani, Guendouzi Tunisia vs France LIVE updates  France's upcoming games France are expected to top Group D comfortably, even if they lose. They are expected to face either Poland or Saudi Arabia on December 4th. In case they do end up as runners-up they will most likely have a rerun of their 2018 Ro16 tie with Argentina on December 3rd.

" Neville, who played with Beckham when he came under intense media attention for his relationship with Victoria Beckham, believes Rashford has simplified his game after dealing with similar scrutiny and got back to doing what he does best. The former United defender also rubbished calls for the club to offload the forward some months ago, claiming that they ""could never sell"" such a talented player. WHAT THEY SAID:  ""There was that period in his life during lockdown where he achieved so much off the pitch,"" Neville told Sky Sports. ""It's hard. I played with [David] Beckham who had that off-the-field focus at times, whether it be in the earlier parts of his career when he started going out with Victoria [Beckham] and he had to cope with that off the pitch scrutiny all the time. Marcus had that for a couple of years whereby it brought pressure. ""Marcus Rashford has got back to what he does, he's simplified his life, he's still achieving great things off the pitch but in a more measured manner. There were people saying that Marcus Rashford needed to be sold by Manchester United. Manchester United could never sell Marcus Rashford. He's a massive talent. It's great to see him in an England shirt, and I think he's pushed himself into a position where he will start on Sunday."" THE BIGGER PICTURE: Rashford became the 2022 World Cup's joint-top scorer after his brace saw England demolish Wales 3-0 to finish top of Group B on Tuesday night. As Neville stated, the resurgent forward - whose first goal came in the form of a stunning free-kick - has played himself into contention for a starting spot on Sunday, as Gareth Southgate is left with a selection headache against AFCON champions Senegal in the round of 16. IN THREE PHOTOS:  DID YOU KNOW? Rashford became the first Manchester United player to score three goals at a major tournament for England since Bobby Charlton at the 1966 World Cup. WHAT NEXT FOR RASHFORD? He will hope he has done enough for a spot in Southgate's starting eleven to face Senegal on Sunday, with a place in the quarter-finals up for grabs.

" How cruel is it that Christian Pulisic celebrated the biggest goal of his career from a hospital bed? As his teammates came together in the locker room to relish in what they'd accomplished, Pulisic underwent scans at a nearby hospital.  Music was surely blasting back in the bowels of Al Thumama Stadium, as evidenced by the absolutely colossal speaker wheeled around by DeAndre Yedlin postgame, but all Pulisic likely heard was the scans going off in some medical facility in Qatar. He did join in on the celebration through Facetime eventually, with teammates saying he was in good spirits after watching them win from afar.  But those teammates also admitted that they truly wished Pulisic had been there to celebrate the moment that he was so vital in creating. It wasn't supposed to be this way for American soccer's superstar. Or maybe it was. Fate has a funny way of working out, doesn't it? Pulisic was always destined to score this goal, the one that sent the USMNT to the knockout stage with a 1-0 win over Iran.  It just made so much sense that it was him, the player that has risen to levels higher than any American player, that led the U.S. to this point. Who else could step in a moment like that and, ultimately, add another chapter to his own legacy, one that now includes a World Cup game-winning goal that saw him exchange his own health for a USMNT win?  Talk about endearing yourself to fans. What more could you ask of a star player? Pulisic puts it away! üò§üé• ¬ª @FOXSoccer  pic.twitter.com/HPId4hsu4a Due to that exchange, though, Pulisic was never given that moment to celebrate what he'd accomplished. He never had that celebration to show off that tiger eye tattoo, to do the Griddy, to fist-pump in jubilation or to do whatever celebration he'd always dreamed of doing when he envisioned this in his head time after time. Instead, as his goal went into the back of the net, sending his teammates and the American fans in attendance into a rapture, he lay in the net wincing in pain. He'd bundled the ball over the line but sacrificed his body in the process. ""It just shows his bravery,"" said USMNT midfielder Kellyn Acosta. ""You just want it so bad. I'm glad that he was finally rewarded with a goal. I know he's super-hungry in front of the net. ""Knowing Christian, he's tough as nails."" Despite the ugliness of it all, it is a goal that will go down in USMNT history.  It may not have the beauty of Landon Donovan against Algeria or the overall importance of Paul Caligiuri's 'Shot Heard Around the World', but for a player of his stature to score on this stage, that automatically puts this finish in USMNT folklore. The goal, in a way, was quintessential Pulisic. He's often associated with his pace or flair but, more often than not, the goals he scores do come from pure effort. As Sergino Dest broke free down the right side, Pulisic saw his chance. He darted between two defenders and made a push for the backpost. Even with Alireza Beiranvand rushing out, Pulisic went all the way in. He got a touch to it and pushed it over the line, but collided with Beiranvand in the process. Afterward, he lay motionless for several minutes before eventually hobbling his way down the sideline. ""It goes like that in his career,"" said captain Tyler Adams. ""Backpost arriving, he's brilliant in that way with the time he is in the box to get in front of that ball. ""He'll do anything for his team in order for us to win. He's a huge player for us."" pic.twitter.com/F7WDxsz8su Adams isn't shortchanging it: Pulisic is huge. Now, though, the U.S. is facing the possibility of a knockout round without their star at 100 percent.  You have to admire the effort Pulisic put forward to finish out the half with a Willis Reed-like comeback but he surely didn't look like a player that was able to continue on in a World Cup game. U.S. Soccer confirmed after the match that Pulisic was at the hospital with an abdominal injury and that his status is still unknown.  He'll have until Saturday to rest up before the U.S. face the Netherlands and the man himself texted WestonMcKennie to tell him that ""You best believe I'll be ready.""  Let's hope so, because it remains to be seen who would, hypothetically, replace Pulisic if he can't play.  Could it be Brenden Aaronson, who came in for the Chelsea star in the second half to provide his endless energy? Or could it be Gio Reyna, who was conspicuously absent once again for the second of three World Cup games? His teammates, though, aren't worried about that yet. They have little doubt Pulisic will be back. ""We wish he was here to celebrate this one because obviously it was his goal,"" said defender Walker Zimmerman, who came off the bench to help the U.S. lock down the win.  ""It was a huge play that put us into the knockout stages and that's what we expect from our players, our big time players like him. ""We're all so happy for him and hopefully he rests up and comes back to contribute."" Added Adams: ""He‚Äôll hang in there. I know he‚Äôll do anything to play in the next game. So, we‚Äôll be counting on him.‚Äù the hotel was ROWDY when we got back üéâüéâüéâüéâ pic.twitter.com/xa5lBnDWO2 They've been counting on him for several years, since he was a 17-year-old teenager hoping to guide the U.S. to the 2018 World Cup.  Ultimately, that pursuit failed, with the lasting image of it all being Pulisic crying on the sidelines as the USMNT's World Cup dreams came to an end. Since that day, it had all been building to this moment, this goal. And Pulisic scored it, just like he always believed he would. It may not have looked like he'd imagined it. It surely didn't feel like he'd imagined it. In his head, it was all probably much sweeter. But there's more to come from Pulisic, who remains the USMNT's bonafide star. He has his first World Cup goal and, if he has anything to say about it, there will be more chances to celebrate further down the line. And maybe, the Soccer Gods will be kind enough to ensure that this is the last goal he ever celebrates from a hospital bed. Who will progress to the FIFA World Cup quarter-finals?

" Mexico certainly made an impression on the 1998 World Cup.  In their spectacular Aztec-design strips, El Tri pulled off three dramatic comebacks in the group stage, while Luis Hernandez scored four times before the curse of ‚ÄòEl quinto partido‚Äô kicked in. However, by that stage, Cuauhtemoc Blanco had left an indelible mark on the tournament ‚Äì with an outrageous, audacious and semi-comical 'trick' that became his trademark. Having been drafted into the squad following Mexico‚Äôs disappointing round-of-16 exit at USA 94, the then-25-year-old Blanco was a little-known name on the global stage, having just returned to Club America from a loan spell with Necaxa.  However, he made himself famous in El Tri‚Äôs opening game at France 98, introducing the tournament to the 'Cuauhtemina' ‚Äì or the ‚ÄòBlanco Bounce‚Äô as it became known in certain parts of the English-speaking world. You may not know it by either name, but you are almost certain to have attempted or fallen victim to this ridiculous manoeuvre on the playground or in the park if you have ever so much as kicked a football. To set the scene, Mexico had levelled against South Korea early in the second half at Lyon‚Äôs old Stade Gerland following an early red card for goalscorer Ha Seok-Ju ‚Äì who was dismissed literally one minute after sticking a free-kick into the back of Jorge Campos‚Äô net. El Tri were growing in confidence and smelled blood, epitomised by Blanco throwing out his Cuauhtemina not once, but twice. With two defenders converging on him on the left flank, he waited until they were close enough before trapping the ball between his ankles and leaping between his bemused opponents and into space.  A lot of you remembered. So go on, pat yourselves on the back üëçüóìÔ∏è #WorldCup 1998, @miseleccionmxEN v @theKFA Sit back and enjoy the 'Cuauhtemi√±a' üçø pic.twitter.com/tFPsrP7p0U The name Cuauhtemoc translates as ‚Äòdescending eagle‚Äô, which is apt when you see footage of Blanco touching down, arms spread wide, prey (the ball) locked between his custom Mexican flag-design Reebok boots. Mexico would go on to beat South Korea 3-1, with Blanco providing the assist for Hernandez‚Äôs sealing strike, and they would be forced to come from behind twice more in their remaining group stage games to qualify for the knockout stage, with Blanco making his most telling contribution from a footballing perspective against Belgium.  Having gone two goals and one man down, El Tri produced a stirring seven-minute comeback to level after their opponents were reduced to 10 men themselves.  It was Blanco who netted the all-important leveller, hurling himself at a deep cross and expertly squeezing the ball inside the back post on the volley with the outside of his left boot. Another creditable comeback draw from two goals down would follow against the Netherlands, courtesy of an injury-time Hernandez equaliser in spite of a last-minute red card.  Consequently, El Tri edged through to the last 16 alongside the Dutch on goal difference. Having held his signature move in reserve since the opening game, Blanco decided the time was right once again against Germany in Montpellier, taking to the air and soaring between Christian Worns and Jorg Heinrich.  However, while he did provide a silky assist for another Hernandez goal to open the scoring, Blanco and his Cuautemina were unable to carry Mexico to a famous victory, as strikes from Jurgen Klinsmann and Oliver Bierhoff saw El Tri finally end up on the wrong side of a come-from-behind win. There was disappointment that Mexico had failed to make the most of what was a talented group of players mainly in their prime, but Blanco had, at least, written himself into World Cup folklore. He became one of the founding members of an exclusive club of esoteric, mercurial footballers who are synonymous with one outrageous piece of skill ‚Äì like Ricardo Quaresma and the 'Trivela', Kerlon and his ‚ÄòSeal dribble‚Äô, Rodrigo Taddei and his dazzling 'Aurelio', and Jay-Jay Okocha with his eponymous turn. Indeed, the Cuautemina has even been immortalised in the FIFA video game series (hold L1 and press R3, if you‚Äôre wondering). It's worth remembering, though, that Blanco achieved great things in a Mexico shirt. His performance in the 1999 Confederations Cup final win over Brazil is the stuff of legend in his homeland.  Indeed, he is widely regarded as one of the best footballers Mexico has ever produced, renowned for his brutish forward play and deceptively quick feet, while he played the game with a take-no-prisoners physicality and had a fiery temper (he was once banned for eye-gouging an opponent) ‚Äì all of which led to him becoming a star in both Liga MX and MLS. However, while he never shied away from the limelight on the field, often courting controversy by taunting opponents with over-the-top goal celebrations, he never truly aligned with the notion of celebrity, believing himself to be the archetypal everyman.  In an interview in 2004, he said: ‚ÄúI don't feel famous. I am the same as a waiter, a [street] sweeper, like any person who works in the maintenance of the club.  ""There are people who have fame and money, but they don't have feelings, which is the most important thing.‚Äù Asked if he felt he was gifted, he added: ‚ÄúI don't know... I would like there to be three or four like me, I wouldn't envy them.‚Äù Never one to shy away from a war of words, though, Blanco would perhaps unsurprisingly move into politics following the end of his playing career as he sought to represent those normal people with whom he felt such a connection.  Initially joining the left-wing Social Democratic Party, he would switch allegiances to the right-wing Social Encounter Party in 2017, having battled allegations of corruption and even murder while municipal president of the city of Cuernavaca in the state of Morelos.  Blanco was elected governor of Morelos in 2018 by a landslide and remains in the post ‚Äì still making a huge impression on the Mexican landscape to this day, but as a politician now, rather than the eagle that descended upon France in 1998 and wowed the world with his signature skill.

" Adams admitted that the team would enjoy their triumph over Iran on Tuesday night, before turning their attention to Saturday's last-16 matchup. The 23-year-old pointed towards the quality the USMNT have already faced in Qatar, and appeared to relish the opportunity to face one of the tournament ""favourites"" in the Netherlands. WHAT THEY SAID: ""[It's a] huge opportunity for us,"" Adams told ESPN. ""It's going to be an amazing game. I think we've obviously played good competition here. Like England, the Netherlands could be another favourite to win the World Cup. They've done really well, how they navigated through their group phase of the tournament so far.  ""[The Netherlands] have some amazing players. We're going to have to be ready for that game, but I think right now we enjoy this moment, have some downtime to relax and recover now, [and then] mentally focus. The coaches will come up with a game plan. It's time for us to execute."" THE BIGGER PICTURE: Adams took over the USMNT captaincy from Chelsea's Christian Pulisic in November - who suffered a pelvic contusion scoring the winner against Iran - and oversaw an unbeaten run in Group B with five points from three games.

WHAT THEY SAID: ""I don't know what [Messi] wants,"" Tebas said at a ceremony for the Spanish Ejecutivos magazine. ""First of all, if he wants to leave PSG; secondly, if PSG will let him leave; and, thirdly, it then depends on what he earns, right? If all these three things fall into place and it's an affordable amount for Barcelona, inside [LaLiga's] financial regulations, he will sign. But it depends on what he earns.

" USMNT's victory against Iran came at a cost as Christian Pulisic and Sargent had to be substituted due to injuries. While Pulisic collided with Iran's keeper Alireza Beiranvand and suffered a pelvic contusion, Sargent ended up standing on a ball that had spun away from him, leading to the 22-year-old overextending his knee. It was later confirmed that it was the forward flex of his ankle that forced him to be substituted in the 77th minute of the match.  WHAT THEY SAID: ""I'm not really sure (how bad it is),"" Sargent told The Athletic. ""I think we'll have to see how it kind of progresses overnight, but we obviously have a very good medical team. So yeah, we're gonna do everything we can. Hopefully, this one is not too bad.""  THE BIGGER PICTURE: The full extent of the injury will be known when Sargent goes for a scan on Wednesday.

" As Poland gear up to take on Argentina in a massive group stage decider, Michniewicz has lavished praise on Messi and compared the forward to legendary former Italian Alpine ski racer Alberto Tomba, who can boast of having won three Olympic gold medals. The tactician believes that his troops must surround the Paris Saint-Germain forward every time he receives the ball as it is impossible for one player to stop him. WHAT THEY SAID: ''Messi on the pitch is like Alberto Tomba on the slope, he‚Äôs able to avoid everyone like Tomba can get around everything,'' said Michniewicz. ''So we need to put players around Messi because if he can get around (them) easily he will easily score. One player cannot stop Messi, we must get players around him. The whole world has been thinking for years about how to stop Lionel Messi and he has made dozens of goals and assists. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll ever find the final answer to this question.'' THE BIGGER PICTURE: This match is also being dubbed as a battle between Robert Lewandowski and Messi, however, Michniewicz insists that the contest will not be decided by just one individual. ""It‚Äôs not only a match between Lewandowski and Messi, it‚Äôs not tennis,'' he said. ''Robert needs his teammates, the same as Leo needs his. We rely on these great strikers but they cannot win on their own.'' IN THREE PHOTOS:   WHAT NEXT FOR MESSI? The Argentina captain will hope that he can inspire his country to victory over Poland and ensure their progress to the round of 16. Both sides will qualify if their match ends in a draw and there is also nothing to separate Saudi Arabia and Mexico in the other final group fixture. Which was the best World Cup winning team?

" Shaw explained that she had been battling cancer for some time and passed before the Three Lions kicked off their tournament. He praised manager Gareth Southgate for his handling of the situation, but clarified that he has had a chance to grieve and is now fully concentrated on the World Cup. WHAT THEY SAID: ‚ÄúMy Nan sadly passed away before (the tournament),‚Äù Shaw told The Athletic. ‚ÄúShe had cancer for a long while and unfortunately she passed away just before the first game. But of course Gareth was really good with me, spoke to me and said: 'Is everything ok?‚Äô If I need to have time away just focus on that. But I‚Äôm here, this World Cup means so much to me and I didn‚Äôt want to miss anything."" On her memory being a source of motivation in Qatar, he said: ‚ÄúShe was a really important part of my childhood. I spent a lot of time with her. Unfortunately, she had cancer for a long while and suffered a lot, so it had been a long thing.

" The Netherlands sealed a knockout berth as group winners after beating Qatar 2-0 on matchday three. Cody Gakpo was once again their star man as he opened the scoring before Frenkie de Jong doubled their lead in the second half. However, Van Gaal got into a verbal altercation with the Dutch media after the game as a reporter questioned his team's style of play and said watching them is like ""grinding teeth"".  WHAT THEY SAID: ""I think you have a different perspective to me, why don‚Äôt you write down it‚Äôs terribly boring. If you think it‚Äôs boring why don‚Äôt you go home,'' The Oranje boss replied to the journalist in question. ""Well that‚Äôs disappointing I think but I don‚Äôt agree with you, I think everyone would be rather proud we‚Äôre progressing to the next round and I think people know why you‚Äôre asking these questions. I don‚Äôt think things are as bad as you say.'' THE BIGGER PICTURE: Although the Dutch have struggled to produce the footballing sparks that are expected of them in the World Cup, they have managed to get the job done and remain unbeaten in the tournament. They looked shaky in a draw against Ecuador on matchday two but came back strongly against Qatar to secure a spot in the round of 16.  IN TWO PHOTOS:     WHAT NEXT FOR THE NETHERLANDS?

" WHAT'S HAPPENING? According to Spanish publication Marca, Ronaldo has been offered a two-year contract by Al-Nassr, who are able to sign the 37-year-old on a free transfer following his departure from Manchester United. THE BIGGER PICTURE Marca reports that Ronaldo has also attracted interest from MLS, but he is very conscious of picking up the most lucrative wage possible if calling time on his illustrious career in Europe. Al-Nassr are willing to pay the Portugal forward a grand total of ‚Ç¨400 million if he agrees on a deal to play for the Saudi Arabian club until 2025. AND WHAT'S MORE Ronaldo's second spell at Old Trafford came to an acrimonious end earlier this month as United announced the termination of his contract by mutual consent. The decision was made following the five-time Ballon d'Or winner's controversial interview with Piers Morgan, during which he accused the club of betraying him and admitted to having no respect for head coach Erik ten Hag. STORY IN TWO PHOTOS  DID YOU KNOW? Should Ronaldo indeed end up joining Al-Nassr, he will link up with another former Premier League star in David Ospina, who played in goal for Arsenal between 2014 and 2019.  WHAT NEXT FOR RONALDO?

" Morocco hope to book their place in the last-16 of the World Cup when they take on Canada on Thursday. The African nation are level on points with Croatia in the top two of the group, but Belgium sit one point behind them. Canada, meanwhile, are looking to avoid finishing their World Cup campaign with three straight defeats, having already gone down to Belgium and Croatia. Canada vs Morocco latest odds Canada are the underdogs to get the win in this match at odds of 5/2 (3.50) with bet365. Morocco are the favourites to pick up three points at odds of 11/10 (2.10) while the draw is priced at 12/5 (3.40). Canada vs Morocco first goal scorer odds Morocco duo Hakim Ziyech and Youssef En-Nesyri are joint-favourites to open the scoring at 11/2 (6.50) while compatriot Abderrazak Hamdallah is available at 6/1 (7.00). Canada star Jonathan David is also priced at 6/1 (7.00) to break the deadlock in his side's favour while Cyle Larin is 7/1 (8.00). Canada vs Morocco preview Morocco are in excellent form heading into the vital fixture. They are now nine games without defeat, having won six and drawn three in that time. Furthermore, they have kept clean sheets in both of their World Cup matches so far, having drawn with Croatia and beaten Belgium. They are hoping to reaach the last-16 for the first time since 1986 and a draw is enough to ensure they go through. Canada, meanwhile, are looking to avoid a third straight loss and ensure they leave Qatar with at least one point. Canada vs Morocco tips and predictions Canada were beaten 4-1 by Croatia last time out while Morocco put two past Belgium so the African nation are expected to find a way through their opponents given the importance of this game. Backing Morocco to score more than 1.5 goals at odds of 6/5 (2.20) looks an appealing bet, then. Odds correct at the time of writing.

" Croatia and Belgium will battle for a place in the last-16 of the World Cup when they go head-to-head on Thursday. Croatia have a slight advantage heading into the final group stage game as they have taken four points from their two matches, while Belgium sit a point behind them. Zlatko Dalic's team will be in high spirits after demolishing Canada 4-1 in matchday two, while Belgium must bounce back from their 2-0 loss to Morocco in the latest round. Croatia vs Belgium latest odds There are no favourites to win this game as both Croatia and Belgium are set at the same price at odds of 13/8 (2.63) with bet365, while the draw is priced at 12/5 (3.40). Croatia vs Belgium first goal scorer odds Romelu Lukaku could be brought back into the starting XI after recovering from injury and is the favourite to open the scoring at 5/1 (6.00) while compatriot Michy Batshuayi, who scored the decisive goal against Canada, is available at 6/1 (7.00). Croatia star Andrej Kramaric, who scored twice against Canada, is priced at 13/2 (7.50) to break the deadlock while Ante Budimir is 7/1 (8.00). Croatia vs Belgium preview Croatia are on an eight-game unbeaten run heading into their crucial match against Belgium. Luka Modric and Co. will be in high spirits following their trouncing of Canada in their last game. Zlatko Dalic's team are in a good position to go through as they need to avoid defeat to ensure they go through. They can even afford to lose the game and still go through as long as Morocco lose to Canada in the group's other match. Belgium, meanwhile, were somewhat lucky to beat Canada in their opening game and were bested by Morocco in their latest game. They must put in a much better performance against the 2018 World Cup runners-up as they are in need of a win to survive in this year's competition. Croatia vs Belgium tips and predictions With both teams eager to get through to the next round, they should be fired up for this game, so backing both teams to score at odds of 3/4 (1.75) looks an appealing bet.

" The USMNT got the better of Iran in their final group-stage match on Tuesday, with Pulisic scoring the only goal of the match in the 38th minute. However, in the process of scoring the goal after connecting to Sergino Dest's cross, he collided with Iran's keeper Alireza Beiranvand. The 24-year-old gingerly got to his feet after receiving treatment, but he had to be substituted at half-time and was taken to hospital for checks. Pulisic's teammate Weston McKennie has since confirmed that he is doing well and should be fit to take to the pitch on Saturday against the Netherlands.  WHAT THEY SAID:  ""I sent him a text and checked on him, and he said, 'Best believe I'll be ready on Saturday,"" said McKennie.  ""Obviously we're very thankful that he threw his body there. At the end it was a heart-drop sinking moment, but we got it done and we're excited to still be here.'' THE BIGGER PICTURE: US Soccer stated that Pulisic was taken to the hospital and has been diagnosed with a pelvic contusion that was termed ""day to day"" in terms of recovery time. USMNT head coach Gregg Berhalter was elated with the commitment that the forward showed and also revealed that the team had a video call with the player to get an update on his condition. ""We got to speak to him and he's in good spirits,"" Berhalter told reporters. ""That's what he does, that's the special quality he has and as soon as a goal is wide he goes in with intensity. He crashes the box and makes it really difficult for defenders with his change of pace. It's a wonderful thing when one of your best players is also one of the most hard-working. He's certainly that. I can't say enough positive things about Christian."" IN THREE PHOTOS:    WHAT NEXT FOR PULISIC?

" Mexico have a mountain to climb against Saudi Arabia after dropping points in their first two games of the World Cup.  They were left frustrated by Poland in their campaign opener as it ended in a stalemate, while in their second match against Lionel Messi's Argentina, they failed to make any impact in the final third whatsoever as the Albiceleste registered a comfortable 2-0 victory.  Mexico enter their third Group C match, against Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, needing to win and get help elsewhere to advance to the knockout stage. Here is everything you need to know about how the El Tri can qualify. What to Mexico need to do to reach last 16?  Mexico will take to the pitch on Wednesday evening at the Lusiail Stadium with the aim to get nothing less than three points. Only a win over the Asian giants will help them to remain in contention for a berth in the round of 16.  However, even if they win, their fortunes are not in their hands. They must also hope that Poland beat Argentina. If Argentina beat or draw with Poland, then El Tri must have a superior goal difference, which seems a tall order.  Currently, they have a goal difference of -2, whereas, both Poland and Argentina have a healthy goal difference of +2 and +1 respectively.  This means that they will have to win big against Saudi Arabia.  History is not on their side as they've now failed to score in four consecutive World Cup outings dating back to 2018.  Who could Mexico face in the last 16?  Mexico can qualify from Group C only as runners-up. So they will be facing the winners from Group D if they progress.  France are leading Group D with a perfect win record. They are set to face Tunisia next in their final group outing and should bag the three points if they play to potential.  If Les Bleus are held to a draw they will still progress as group winners. However, if they lose heavily and Australia beat Denmark by a big margin then France will go through as runners-up.  In that case, Mexico will face Australia in the round of 16.  The game would take place at the Al Thumama Stadium on December 4. It has not yet been decided who will air Mexico's last-16 tie, although the game will be shown on either ITV or BBC. Both channels also offer online streaming access, via BBC iPlayer and ITVX.

" Unfancied heading into the World Cup, Australia's players stand on the edge of potential glory in Qatar, knowing that they are 90 minutes away from footballing immortality in a country that is still learning to love the beautiful game. A draw against Denmark may well be enough for the Socceroos to reach the knockout stages of the competition for just the second time, while a win will guarantee progression for Graham Arnold's team. Theirs is a squad of few star names, with perhaps Celtic midfielder Aaron Mooy ‚Äì who had stints in the Premier League with Huddersfield Town and Brighton ‚Äì the most recognisable to European fans. If things had gone differently, though, then Australia could have had one of Serie A's rising stars amongst their number.  Roma attacking midfielder Cristian Volpato has already made an impact on the first team at Stadio Olimpico, and Arnold was keen for him to join up with the Socceroos squad in Qatar. The 19-year-old turned them down, though, instead choosing to wait on making a decision over his international football. Given his talent, it is a call that is unlikely to define his career. But what makes him so special, and why were Australia so keen to have him at the World Cup?  Let NXGN explain...",football
" With one swing of his left foot, Lionel Messi announced Argentina's belated arrival at the 2022 World Cup. And the noise that welcomed them back onto the game's grandest stage was deafening. Ear plugs were rendered useless by an explosion of Argentine joy at the Lusail Iconic Stadium. There was relief there too, though, and plenty of it. ""A weight off our shoulders,"" Messi admitted after their 2-0 win over Mexico on Saturday night. The days leading up to the game had been ""very long"", the skipper said, with the players bitterly ""angry"" with themselves for having slipped to a shock 2-1 loss to Saudi Arabia in their Group C opener. Goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez even admitted having spoken with a psychologist. ""I suffered a lot,"" he confessed. ""They took two shots at me and I conceded both. I have 45 million Argentines behind me and I should have given more."" The onus was, of course, on Messi to give more. He had opened the scoring against Saudi Arabia, from the penalty spot, but he too had faded after a bright first half, meaning he was facing a humiliating first-round exit at his final World Cup. His goal, then, represented a release, for him and his team-mates. And the coaches too. Pablo Aimar was reduced to tears by Messi's 64th-minute strike. That's how much it meant to them. And perfectly illustrated just how much pressure they're all under.  Messi, of course, carries most of the burden. And usually makes light of it. As Angel Di Maria said, his assist for the equaliser wasn't a particularly good pass. ""I threw him a turd but he always finds solutions to everything,"" the veteran winger enthused. ""He scored a tremendous goal and I just don‚Äôt have words for him any more.  ""I have had the chance to play with the best player in the world at club level, and for 14 years with the national team, and for me Leo is everything."" Messi cannot do it all, though. Not at a World Cup. It's impossible for one man to carry an entire team. People like to perpetrate the myth that Maradona won the 1986 edition all on his own, but that does a gross disservice to the likes of Jorge Valdano, Jorge Burruchaga and Jose Luis Brown ‚Äì men who stepped up to the mark when their country needed them most. If Lionel Scaloni's Argentina are to have any hope of emulating that side, it is imperative that Messi's supporting cast play their parts. It is worrying, then, that so many of the protagonists from last year's Copa America triumph have gone missing in Qatar.  The injury-enforced absence of Giovani Lo Celso was obviously a massive blow, and one that Scaloni could have done little about. However, he now has a major issue in midfield, given Leandro Paredes and Rodrigo De Paul, who started alongside Lo Celso in the 1-0 win over Brazil in Rio in July of last year, have both performed abysmally thus far.  Indeed, Paredes was dropped after his horror show against the Saudis, while De Paul failed dismally to justify his retention in the starting line-up against Mexico, giving the ball away 16 times in total. Thus far, the midfield duo have looked exactly what they are: two men who have arrived in Qatar undercooked after little football at club level this season. Cristian Romero is also seriously lacking minutes because of his injury issues, looking a shadow of the player who made such an impact at the Copa, and it was no surprise to see him quickly lose his starting spot to Lisandro Martinez. Lautaro Martinez has no excuse, though, for his lack of match sharpness. The 25-year-old has led the Inter attack for the majority of the first half of the 2022-23 Serie A campaign, but the concern is that one of the streakiest strikers in world football is in one of his infamously fallow periods.  There is, therefore, a clamour for Julian Alvarez to start up front in the must-min match against Poland, even though he is only 22 and effectively Erling Haaland's understudy at Manchester City. Scaloni has no other centre-forward available to him if he does decide to bench Lautaro, so there will be a temptation to stick with a player who contributed three goals to their victorious Copa campaign.  But it would not be a surprise to see Argentina take to the field without five of the players who started against Brazil in Rio: Lo Celso (injured), Paredes, De Paul, Romero and Lautaro. That is a sign of just how much this previously rock-solid Argentina side has been destabilised over the past few days.  A team on a 36-game undefeated run now knows that a second loss in the space of a week would send them out of a tournament that many pundits tipped them to win.  Poland represent a formidable foe, too. Wojciech Szczesny is looking unbeatable in goal, Piotr Zielinski has brought his Napoli form with him to Qatar, while Robert Lewandowski's tournament is up and running after his own sluggish start. More Messi magic may well be required. But there‚Äôs only so many times they can ask him to turn a ‚Äòturd‚Äô into something truly tremendous. Which was the best World Cup winning team?

The contract got as low as $49.95 a barrel earlier in the session, its lowest level since May 1, 2009.European benchmark Brent oil for February delivery fell $3.31 to $53.11 a barrel in London.MondayÔøΩs slide in oil prices followed indications of rising output from key producers Russia and Iraq at a time when forecasters have trimmed their demand projections due to weak global economic growth.The breaching of the psychologically important $50 level also came on a turbulent day for global financial markets. US stocks fell nearly two percent, approaching the drops in European equity markets as the euro plunged to a nine-year low on revived eurozone worries.A long rally in the greenback, which gained 11 percent last year against a basket of major currencies, has weighed on the dollar-priced oil market by making crude more expensive for buyers using weaker currencies.Oil prices could fall further still, analysts say.""ThereÔøΩs serious concern the bottomÔøΩs not in yet,"" said Kyle Cooper, managing partner at IAF Advisors in Houston. ""Basically everyone whoÔøΩs taken a stab at the bottom has been wrong.""""Oil prices attempted to stabilize during the last two weeks, but the fundamentals remain weak,"" said Gene McGillian, broker and analyst at Tradition Energy. ""The market is trying to come to a bottom. It could be anybodyÔøΩs guess, but it appears we still have more to go.""Fawad Razaqzada, a technical analyst at Forex.com., said the drop below $50 a barrel could trigger more selling, paving the way for oil to fall as low as $45 or $40 a barrel in the coming weeks.-Weak fundamentals-The retreat in prices comes on the heels of a multi-year boom in US oil production that has shaken the global petroleum market and put the US in a league with oil giants Russia and Saudi Arabia.Other leading producers are also pumping aggressively. IraqÔøΩs oil ministry last week released figures showing that December crude exports reached their highest since 1980.Meanwhile, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has consistently ruled out action despite the months-long slide in prices.In November, the cartel met in Vienna and took no action, as key powerbrokers like Saudi Arabian oil minister Ali al-Naimi said he preferred for the market to balance itself. In December, Naimi told a Middle East publication the group would take the same hands-off approach even if oil fell to $20 a barrel.Meanwhile, economic growth remains uncertain in Europe and in many emerging economies, such as China and Brazil. The International Energy Agency in December projected global crude inventories could rise by nearly 300 million barrels in the first six months of 2015. The agency also cut its demand outlook by more than 200,000 barrels a day for 2015.Energy equities, by far the worst performing sector in the S&P 500 last year, suffered more pain Monday. Dow member Chevron fell 4.0 percent, while oil-services giant Schlumberger lost 2.6 percent.Key US oil companies like ConocoPhillips and shale producer Continental Resources have cut their drilling budgets for 2015.Still, analysts expect US output to continue to rise this year, owing to investments that have already been made. That will put more pressure on crude prices.""I still think one of the primary drivers of the market is US oil production and I really donÔøΩt see US oil production growth slowing appreciably in the first quarter,"" Cooper said.

"Saudi Arabia's new king is expected to continue a policy of keeping oil output steady to drive out rival producers, though the royal succession has focused market attention on the future of the kingdom's long-serving oil minister.King Abdullah died early on Friday and his brother Salman became king, the royal court in the world's top oil exporter said in a statement.Salman named his half-brother Muqrin as heir, rapidly moving to forestall any succession crisis at a moment when Saudi Arabia faces unprecedented turmoil on its borders.While the new king is not seen as likely to change Abdullah's policies of keeping output high to protect the OPEC cartel's market share, some analysts said the succession has focused attention on the future of the oil minister Ali Al-Naimi.""King Abdullah was the architect of the current strategy to keep production high and force out smaller players instead of cutting,"" said John Kilduff, partner, Again Capital LLC in New York, adding that he expected Salman to keep production high.FGE analyst Tushar Bansal said: ""By and large, as of now, no major change is expected in Saudi policies"" but he said the market would focus on whether the oil minister might step down.""Ali Al-Naimi has been the oil minister since 1995... It was reported that he expressed a desire to step down, but King Abdullah asked him to stay on for as long as he is around. So, the real question is, if there is a new oil minister soon, will it lead to a change in Saudi energy policy?""IHS oil consultant Victor Shum said speculation over the fate of the oil minister could add to market uncertainty though he did not expect a change of minister or in overall policy.""The decision on Saudi Arabia to keep pumping (oil) was made regardless of who the king may be,"" said Shum.Saudi leaders were also unlikely to want to repeat some previous policy misfires.In the 1980s, Saudi Arabia cut its own output to prop up prices in the face of falling demand and rising supplies from non-OPEC suppliers but was dealt a double blow from lower prices and reduced output.Saudi policymakers would be determined not to make the same mistake again, analysts said.Crude oil futures jumped on Friday after news of the Saudi king's death but later came off their highs and were still trading at levels more than 50 percent below their most recent peaks in June, 2014.

"Pakistan's ongoing fuel shortage that has led to worsening power blackouts is weighing on its credit worthiness and hindering its ability to meet key reform targets laid out by the IMF, ratings agency MoodyÔøΩs warned Monday. The country is currently in the grip of one of its worst power crises in years due to a shortfall in imported oil, with the situation exacerbated Sunday by an attack on a key powerline in restive Balochistan province. MoodyÔøΩs said that increasing energy imports without addressing structural issues that create so-called circular debt ""will further strain Pakistan's budget and balance of payments, a credit negative"". ""Fuel shortages also reflect the strained finances of state-owned distribution companies and the fuel importer, Pakistan State Oil corporation, and are a setback to the sector's progress on reforms made so far under Pakistan's financial support program with the International Monetary Fund.""The IMF granted a $6.6-billion loan to Pakistan in September 2013 on the condition that it carry out extensive economic reforms, particularly in the energy and taxation sectors.MoodyÔøΩs, which in July 2014 upgraded Pakistan's rating outlook from ""negative"" to ""stable"" in a boon for the shaky South Asian economy, said that structural reforms had been a ""key driver"" in its decision last year. ""Circular debt"" -- brought on by the dual effect of the government setting low electricity prices and customers failing to pay -- is at the heart of the crisis. State utilities lose money, and cannot pay private power generating companies, which in turn cannot pay the oil and gas suppliers, who cut off the supply. The fuel crisis began last week when Pakistan State Oil was forced to slash imports because banks refused to extend any more credit to the government-owned company, which supplies 80 percent of the countryÔøΩs oil. The shortfall led to long queues of angry motorists at petrol stations, though these have since dissipated as fuel supplies have reached the pumps. But MoodyÔøΩs warned that the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, which made solving the energy crisis a key campaign pledge, had so far failed to offer policy solutions and increasing oil supplies would only add to the fiscal burden. ""The governmentÔøΩs targeted fiscal deficit of 4.5 percent of GDP in fiscal 2015 from 4.7 percent in fiscal 2014 is already impeded by delays in implementing electricity tariff adjustments and legal challenges related to tax collections,"" it said. Increasing fuel imports, which currently comprise 35 percent of total imports would further weigh on PakistanÔøΩs import bill, it added.",other

The market is in a risk-on mode.""The euro plunged to as low as $1.1098 at one point in Asia Monday, the lowest level since September 2003, before recovering later in the day to close out in New York at $1.1234.On Tuesday in Asia it bought $1.1250.It also sank to 131.55 yen Monday in Asia before bouncing to end the day at 133.12 yen. It bought 133.31 yen in Tokyo Tuesday.The dollar edged up to 118.47 yen from 118.49 yen in US trade.Oil prices edged up slightly after falling to fresh six-year lows Monday, despite a warning from the OPEC cartel that prices could punch $200 owing to shrinking investment in exploration.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for March delivery rose five cents to $45.20 while Brent crude for March gained 13 cents to $48.29.Gold fetched $1,276.39 an ounce, against $1,281.39 late Monday.

"Oil prices rebounded Tuesday from six-year lows as the dollar weakened after disappointing US economic data.The US benchmark, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for March delivery, rose $1.08 (2.4 percent) to close at $45.16 a barrel.Brent North Sea crude for March settled at $49.60 a barrel in London, up $1.44 from MondayÔøΩs closing level.""The market has found a bottom in the mid-40 range,"" said Kyle Cooper of IAF Advisors.Crude futures sank Monday to their lowest closing levels since early 2009. Crude has shed nearly 60 percent of its value in an almost uninterrupted slide since June due to a supply glut, largely boosted by robust US shale-oil production and weaker global economic growth.The greenback has been strengthening for months, making dollar-priced oil relatively more expensive, adding to the pressure on the oil market.A slight easing in the dollar Tuesday against major rival currencies such as the euro, yen and pound underpinned the buying, Cooper said.""I didnÔøΩt see anything bullish today"" for WTI, he said. ""Equities are down, durable goods (are) not that good.""New orders for long-lasting US industrial goods unexpectedly fell in December, by a steep 3.4 percent, signaling some persistent weakness in the manufacturing sector.Saudi Aramco, the worldÔøΩs largest oil company in terms of crude production and exports, acknowledged that prices have fallen too far but it was up to the market, not OPEC producers, to shore them up.""ItÔøΩs too low for everybody,"" said Khalid al-Falih, the president of the state-owned energy giant, told a conference in Riyadh. ""I think even consumers start to suffer in the long term.""Falih also said US shale-oil production is important for the worldÔøΩs long-term energy future and Saudi Aramco has earmarked an additional $7 billion for its own shale projects.The kingdom is the leading exporter and top producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which provides about a third of global oil supplies.In November, OPEC resisted calls to reduce output in the face of falling prices, keeping its output ceiling at 30 million barrels per day in a decision that exacerbated the global price slump.

"State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) governor on Thursday urged the countryÔøΩs Islamic banks to develop ways to reward their customers in line with a surge in the sectorÔøΩs profitability, or face regulatory action. Islamic finance is experiencing a revival in Pakistan, aided by an ambitious five-year plan that regulators hope will double the industryÔøΩs share of the banking sector to 20 percent by 2020.A growing client base and improving asset quality helped Islamic banks post profits before tax of 12 billion rupees ($119.1 million) in the third quarter of last year, almost double the year-earlier amount, central bank data shows. But regulators want to tackle consumer perceptions that Islamic banks falter when it comes to social responsibility and ethical banking practices.The average financing-to-deposit spread - the difference between what banks charge for financing and what they pay their depositors - for all lenders, Islamic and conventional, remains high and should be ""reasonably rationalised"", central bank governor Ashraf Wathra said in a speech to a gathering of industry executives on Monday. He did not specify a satisfactory level, but singled out Islamic banks as the ones needing to reward customers in line with a rise in profits.""Banks were advised to come up with their own solutions or the SBP will apply sharia-compliant measures to address the issue,"" said Wathra. He did not elaborate, but in the past the central bank has prescribed minimum targets for banks to lend to specific sectors of the economy such as agriculture and small business. Islamic banks follow religious principles which ban the charging of interest and gambling, and stress the sharing of risk and profits. The industry has developed a range of sharia-compliant financial tools, some with greater profit-sharing qualities than others. Islamic banks fall short when it comes to using strongly profit-sharing instruments such as musharaka, whose share of overall Islamic financing in Pakistan was only 10.1 percent as of September, compared to 4.2 percent a year earlier. Musharaka is a partnership in which two or more parties agree to provide capital, sharing both profits and losses according to a stipulated ratio. By contrast, murabaha - a cost-plus-profit arrangement where one party agrees to buy merchandise for another - commands the lionÔøΩs share of financing by the countryÔøΩs Islamic banks, at 30.3 percent. Murabaha is often criticised for lacking economic substance and its resemblance to a conventional loan. ",other

"US authorities are investigating the credit rating agency Moody's over its glowing assessments of mortgage deals in the runup to the 2008 financial crisis, The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday.Citing people familiar with the situation, the newspaper said Justice Department officials had met with several former Moody's executives. It wasn't yet clear if the probe would result in a lawsuit.If the investigation is confirmed, Moody's would become the second major US credit-rating firm in the Justice Department's crosshairs, after a case against Standard & Poor's.S&P is expected to within days agree to pay $1.37 billion to settle lawsuits over its rosy grading of mortgage bonds in the financial crisis, sources told AFP.Neither Moody's nor the Justice Department were immediately reachable for comment Sunday.US authorities are probing whether the firm compromised its standards to score deals, the Journal reported, and the focus is on residential mortgage deals from about 2004 to 2007.Positive ratings on what turned out to be extremely risky mortgage deals, known as subprime loans, were a main cause of the 2008 financial collapse.Investors rely on rating firms' grades to assess risk.Numerous banks have already paid huge fines and settlements for their roles in packaging and selling the bonds as low-risk, solid investments.

"Global oil prices slid Wednesday following a three-day rally as dealers were divided on whether the commodity has bottomed out after a plunge of nearly 60 percent since June. US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for delivery in March shed $1.72 to stand at $51.33 a barrel compared with TuesdayÔøΩs close.Brent North Sea crude for March slid $1.15 a barrel to trade at $56.76 in London afternoon trade.WTI had soared $3.48 Tuesday to record its highest finish since December 31, while Brent jumped $3.16 to a similar closing peak, as dealers cheered signs that the oil industry is tightening exploration activities to cap a supply glut.Ken Hasegawa, an energy trading manager at Newedge Group in Tokyo, said the crude market was ""extremely volatile"" after the three-day rally that began Friday saw prices surge nearly 20 percent.""It has become increasingly difficult to discern the direction of the prices of crude oil, but the fundamentals remain unchanged,"" Hasegawa told AFP. He added that prices could ""fluctuate by increasing up to $10 and falling up to $10"" in the short term.Deep cuts in capital spending by major oil companies, including new announcements Tuesday by BP and BG Group, had suggested there would be tighter supplies in the future. The Baker Hughes North America rig count report for the week to January 30 showed a drop of 128 rigs to 1,937. That compared with 2,393 a year ago.Some analysts however remain doubtful that the current oil price rebound will be sustained as supplies still outweigh demand in the immediate term.The oil market has lost more than half its value since June largely owing to a surge in global reserves boosted by robust US shale oil production. The problem was exacerbated in November after OPEC decided to maintain output levels despite plunging prices.The 12-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) cartel pumps about 30 percent of global crude supplies.

The Guardian, along with other news outlets, cited documents obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) via Le Monde.HSBC said that its Swiss arm had not been fully integrated into HSBC after its purchase in 1999, allowing ""significantly lower"" standards of compliance and due diligence to persist.The Guardian alleged in its report that the files showed HSBC's Swiss bank routinely allowed clients to withdraw ÔøΩbricksÔøΩ of cash, often in foreign currencies which were of little use in Switzerland, marketed schemes which were likely to enable wealthy clients to avoid European taxes and colluded with some to conceal undeclared accounts from domestic tax authorities.HSBC said the Swiss private banking industry, long known for its secrecy, operated differently in the past and this may have resulted in HSBC having had ""a number of clients that may not have been fully compliant with their applicable tax obligations.""Its private bank, especially its Swiss arm, had undergone ""a radical transformation"" in recent years, it said in a detailed four-page statement.HSBC's Swiss private bank was largely acquired as part of its purchase of Republic National Bank of New York and Safra Republic Holdings, a US private bank.HSBC said the number of accounts in its Swiss private bank had fallen from 30,412 in 2007 to 10,343 at the end of last year and it was cooperating with authorities investigating tax matters.The data was supplied by Herve Falciani, a former IT employee of HSBC's Swiss private bank. HSBC said Falciani downloaded details of accounts and clients at the end of 2006 and early 2007. French authorities have obtained data on thousands of the customers and shared them with tax authorities elsewhere, including Argentina.Switzerland has charged Falciani, who Reuters was unable to reach for comment, with industrial espionage and breaching the country's secrecy laws.

"The Federal Bureau of Revenue (FBR) has begun chasing wealthy tax-dodgers who enjoy lives of extravagance and luxury, but revenue officials face huge challenges in trying to force the very richest ÔøΩ and most influential ÔøΩ to pay up.Pakistan's tax-to-GDP ratio of 9.5 percent is among the lowest in the world and the government is under pressure from foreign donors and lenders, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), to increase collection to boost the struggling economy.Revenue authorities say they have identified about a quarter of a million new taxpayers who they project will add around 14 billion rupees ($140 million) to government coffers.Broadening the tax base and improving the economy after years of drift and sluggish growth under the last government was a key pledge in Prime Minister Nawaz SharifÔøΩs 2013 election campaign, when he was swept to power for a third time.Currently less than one percent of Pakistanis pay income tax and the government collected just $8 billion in total income tax in the 2013-14 fiscal year ÔøΩ barely enough to cover just the countryÔøΩs defence expenditure of $7 billion.The finance ministry is aiming to boost the tax-to-GDP ratio to 15 percent in the current fiscal year ending June 30.As part of those efforts, the FBR is compiling lifestyle and vehicle data to try to trace unregistered taxpayers, including wealthy landlords and businessmen zipping between their luxury homes in imported Mercedes.""We are collecting information from the vehicle registration authority, car manufacturers, utility companies, telecom companies and property registration offices and tracing people who are not paying any tax,"" FBR spokesman Shahid Hussain told AFP.Taxpayer profilesThe data is used to generate profiles of potential taxpayers, after which demands are issued for them to pay income tax.""FBR has already issued notices to 261,250 potential tax payers,"" Hussain told AFP, adding that that new taxpayers have paid 570 million rupees since the crackdown started.It is not just dodgy businessmen who have been caught ÔøΩ several lawmakers have been found paying either no tax or very little and not filing their mandatory annual tax statements.The FBR has taken punitive measures against some ""chronic defaulters"", freezing nearly 300 bank accounts, seizing more than 100 vehicles, putting 78 properties up for sale and issuing arrest warrants in 40 cases.""Employing information technology, the FBR is creating a central database which would contain information about all taxpayers and nobody will be left undetected,"" Hussain said.A new FBR department tasked with broadening the tax net started working in July 2013 and within one year it started showing results, he added.But Pakistan is a country where wealth and political influence go hand in hand. For generations, landowners and industrialists have given patronage to political parties and scant attention has been paid to their assets by the taxman.Changing this privileged arrangement is a tricky proposition.Umar Cheema, an investigative journalist for Pakistani daily The News who has done several major exposes on tax-dodgers, says the FBRÔøΩs commitment is encouraging, but he does not expect them to net any big fish.ÔøΩWar on tax cheatsÔøΩ""FBR is after those who canÔøΩt influence them,"" Cheema told AFP, citing several well-known tycoons considered among PakistanÔøΩs richest whose names were missing from a list of the countryÔøΩs top 100 taxpayers.""It can be done only by waging a war against tax cheaters without discrimination of good and bad cheaters,"" Cheema said.PakistanÔøΩs central bank said in a recent report that tax revenue growth was not keeping up with budget targets.The tax take grew 11.7 percent in the first quarter of the current fiscal year, against an annual target of 26.9 percent ÔøΩ but this was only half the growth of the same period during the previous fiscal year, according to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).The central bank has urged the government to simplify tax procedures and do more to increase the documentation of the economy.A vast amount of business in Pakistan is done off the books, making transactions hard to trace and levy dues on.""Although FBR has taken a number of measures to increase tax collection, these focused more on deductions at source, and/or increasing the tax rates,"" a recent SBP report said, warning such measures had enjoyed ""limited success"" in the past.The IMF, though, has said the governmentÔøΩs reform programme ÔøΩ tied to a $6.6 billion loan from the Washington-based lender ÔøΩ was on track, and expects growth to accelerate to 4.3 percent in the 2014-15 fiscal year from 4.1 percent previously.But even with growth quickening and officials insisting they are making inroads, challenges to the governmentÔøΩs efforts to gather taxes remain considerable.",other

"Oil prices fell in thin pre-holiday trade in Asia Thursday after a mixed US stockpiles report, while talks over crude producer IranÔøΩs nuclear programme dragged on, analysts said.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate fell 40 cents to $49.69 while Brent slipped 32 cents to $56.78 in afternoon trade.""Prices have come off with thin volumes ahead of the holiday tomorrow,"" Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney, told AFP.Financial markets in major crude trading hubs including Singapore, the United States and Britain will be closed on Friday for the long Easter weekend.McCarthy said dealers were still digesting the latest US Department of EnergyÔøΩs weekly petroleum report released Wednesday.The report, for the week to March 27, showed another increase in inventories to a new record high of 471.4 million barrels.But it also revealed a slight decline in US production of 36,000 barrels per day, ending a long climb to record output levels that have contributed to the global supply glut.""The decline in crude production does give some hope that the state of oversupply can be brought under control, and bring about a lift in prices,"" McCarthy said.Talks between Iran and world powers aimed at preventing Tehran from getting a nuclear bomb remained in focus, he added.""We are a few metres... from the finishing line, but we are well aware that the final metres are the hardest,"" French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius told reporters as he arrived late Wednesday back in Switzerland to rejoin the negotiations.The United States, China, Britain, Russia, France and Germany hope a full agreement, due to be finalised by June 30, will see Iran scale back its nuclear capability, which would prevent Tehran from developing a nuclear weapon.In return, the diplomatically isolated Islamic republic, which denies wanting to build a bomb, is demanding the lifting of sanctions that have strangled its energy-reliant economy.

"Crude-oil prices fell Thursday after six world powers and Iran announced they had agreed on a framework to curb IranÔøΩs nuclear drive.With the tentative deal, if confirmed, likely to allow Iran crude exports back on the markets, Brent North Sea crude for delivery in May, the global benchmark contract, slumped $2.15, settling at $54.95 a barrel in London trade.The US benchmark, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for May delivery, shed 95 cents to close at $49.14 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.Traders have been following the marathon negotiations closely. Shortly before the New York market closed, the world powers and Iran said that Tehran has agreed to curtail its nuclear program in return for the lifting of US and European Union nuclear-related sanctions that have harmed its economy.Lifting sanctions could open up the flow of Iranian crude to an oversupplied global market. The glut has pushed crude prices more than 50 percent lower since last June.The outline of the deal marked a major breakthrough in a 12-year standoff between Iran and the West, which has long feared Tehran wants to build a nuclear bomb. Iran has insisted the nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.At the beginning of the press conference in Lausanne, Switzerland, the price of WTI, which had been trading lower since the market opened, fell to $48.11 a barrel before paring its losses.The countries announced the drafting of a full agreement would begin immediately, with a June 30 deadline for completion.The sanctions would be lifted after the UN atomic agency verifies Iran has fulfilled the terms of the deal.The so-called P5+1 group ÔøΩ the United States, Britain, China, France and Russia plus Germany ÔøΩ hope that the deal will make it virtually impossible for Iran to make nuclear weapons under the guise of its civilian program.Commerzbank analysts, citing shipping sources, said earlier this week that Iran has at least 30 million barrels of crude oil in storage onboard tankers that could quickly move onto the market if sanctions were lifted.Iran has the worldÔøΩs fourth-largest oil reserves. The OPEC memberÔøΩs crude exports have fallen from more than 2.2 million barrels per day in 2011 to about 1.3 million bpd because of the US-EU sanctions.Traders also kept an eye on the latest Baker Hughes count of US crude-oil drilling rigs, looking for clues that the strong US crude output could be easing. The count fell by 11 rigs from last week, and the number of operating rigs has fallen more than 50 percent since October.",other
"Oil futures climbed more than $1 a barrel on Monday, after Saudi Arabia raised prices for crude sales to Asia for a second month, signalling better demand in the region.International benchmark Brent regained ground after tumbling as much as 5 percent on Thursday, when a preliminary nuclear deal was finally reached between world powers and Iran. More Iranian oil could enter global markets if that is followed by a comprehensive deal by June.But analysts warned a ramp-up in exports could take months and would likely not happen before 2016.""While clearly a bearish headline, a final deal and full lifting of sanctions still faces a number of obstacles,"" Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note.""Even if a final deal is reached, we do not expect any physical market impact before 2016,"" the analysts said.Brent crude for May delivery touched a high of $56.19 a barrel and was up $1.19 from Thursday at $56.14 by 0635 GMT. US crude for May delivery was $1.21 higher at $50.35 a barrel, after earlier touching $50.48.There was no settlement in either Brent or US crude futures on Friday as markets were closed for the start of the Easter holiday.Despite the sanctions on Iran, China's imports from the OPEC producer are set to rise from August as a Chinese state trader has signed a deal with the National Iranian Oil Company to buy more condensate.The world's top exporter Saudi Arabia kept output steady and cut its official selling prices (OSPs) sharply late last year in a fight for market share during a global supply glut.Its ability to raise prices for April and May suggests its strategy is working, although competition has kept its flagship Arab Light at a discount to Oman/Dubai quotes, analysts said.""There is still competition for the Asia market even though it is also a sign that some of the production elsewhere is less able to compete in the market right now,"" said Shunling Yap, a senior oil and gas analyst at BMI Research.On the supply front, the number of rigs drilling for oil in the United States declined by 11 last week to 802, the smallest drop since December, a weekly survey by oil service firm Baker Hughes showed on Thursday.Two weeks of small declines in the US rig count have raised expectations that drilling activity is nearing a level that could dent output, bolster prices and coax rigs back to the field after a precipitous cull since October.",other

Brent North Sea crude for May lost 46 cents to $57.66 in midday trade.The contracts had surged by three dollars each on Monday.""The current decline in oil prices is most likely due to profit-taking,"" Ken Hasegawa, energy trading manager at Newedge Group, told AFP. Analysts attributed the steep gains on Monday to investors concluding that the nuclear framework agreed between Iran and international powers will have a minimal near-term effect on global crude supplies.The deal Tehran agreed with the United States, Britain, China, France and Russia plus Germany paves the way for the Islamic republic to curtail its nuclear activity in exchange for relief from punishing economic sanctions, including on oil investment.""Most traders were waiting on Iran nuclear talks to cause a flood in Iranian oil as sanctions get lifted,"" said Daniel Ang, investment analyst at Phillip Futures in Singapore. ""However, the tone from the US seems firm and this means that sanctions would only be lifted slowly,"" he added.Iran has the worldÔøΩs fourth-largest oil reserves but its exports have fallen from more than 2.2 million barrels per day in 2011 to about 1.3 million because of the US-EU sanctions, which were put in place to prevent it building a nuclear bomb.

"Asian markets rallied Wednesday, led by an almost four percent surge in Hong Kong on its first post-holiday trading day as it reacted to weak US jobs data that reduced the chances of a rate rise any time soon.The Japanese central bankÔøΩs decision to delay any new easing measures pushed the yen up against the dollar, while investors await the release of minutes from the Federal ReserveÔøΩs latest policy meeting.Oil prices ticked lower on profit-taking in Asia after climbing Tuesday to their highest level of 2015.Hong Kong, which last traded on Thursday, soared 3.80 percent, or 961.22 points, to 26,236.86.Shanghai ended 0.84 percent, or 33.43 points higher at 3,994.81 and Tokyo added 0.76 percent, or 149.27 points, to 19,789.81.Sydney rose 0.59 percent, or 34.7 points, to 5,960.7 and Seoul advanced 0.60 percent, or 12.23 points, to end at 2,059.26.Last weekÔøΩs Labor Department data showing that the US economy created fewer jobs in March than it had for more than a year raised expectations that rates will be kept low through the summer.The next focal point is the release later Wednesday of minutes from the last Fed meeting, with dealers poring over them for clues about when the bank plans to announce a rise.In currency trading the dollar edged down after the Bank of Japan stood pat on monetary policy even though the country is struggling to overcome anaemic price growth.The dollar bought 119.88 yen, down from 120.32 yen in New York Tuesday but well above the low-119 yen range seen in Tokyo at the start of the week soon after the US jobs data.- Greece fears linger -""ThereÔøΩs still a little bit of doubt in the market as to really where the US economy is, and more importantly, how the Fed perceives the US economy,"" Raiko Shareef, a markets strategist in Wellington at Bank of New Zealand, told Bloomberg News.

"Lending to private sector contracted by 36.5 percent during the first nine months of the current fiscal year of 2014/15, despite the central bankÔøΩs efforts to get credit flowing through thrice cut in policy rates, data showed on Tuesday.Analyst said banksÔøΩ hefty invested into the government papers and low borrowing costs have made little success in investment and spending by the businesses and consumers.The flow of loans to different firms fell to Rs178.9 billion between July 1, 2014 and April 3, 2015 against Rs281.9 billion during the same period of last fiscal year, the central bank said.Analysts said that bank heavy investment in the government treasury reduced the supply of lendable funds for the private sector despite falling borrowing costs.Since the start of 2014, banks have been actively placing funds in long-term Pakistan Investment Bonds, which carry much higher returns than the weighted average lending rate banks get from the industrial sector.And the central bank also continued to pump liquidity into the banking system to meet the shortage in the market because of banksÔøΩ higher investment in the government papers.The State Bank of Pakistan injected a record high Rs842 billion into the banking system on March 20, through the opening market operations.TuesdayÔøΩs data on monetary aggregates depicted that the government borrowing from commercial banks reached at high level of Rs1.230 trillion from a same period a year ago.The governmentÔøΩs rising demand for bank borrowing has pushed out the private sector from banking.According to report from a brokerage house, investment to deposit ratio (IDR) of banks increased to 61.2pc in 2014 as compared to 54.1pc in the preceding year. Investment in government securities touched new peak as such a high IDR level has never been achieved previously.Though yields on the government papers are falling (7pc on T-bills and 8-9pc on PIBs), an anticipation of further cut in discount rate pushes banks to lock-in funds in PIBs on high returns.Since November 2014, the cumulative discount rate has been reduced by 200 basis points following low inflation and positive outlook on external sector.The government is not firmly agreed with the analystsÔøΩ view that banks are not interested in extending private sector loans and parking their whole money into the government papers.The government in its latest letter of intent to the IMF said, ÔøΩPrivate sector credit continued its healthy expansion (10.2 percent so far in FY15) driven mainly by businesses, and in particular manufacturing.ÔøΩSome analysts foresee bank lending to start expanding in coming quarters. Within different financing segments, a moderate pickup is expected in consumer loans.The State Bank, with the help of World Bank experts, has developed a comprehensive National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) to implement financial sector reforms to meet their financing needs. The central bank is likely to launch the NFIS by end-April 2015.In order to improve the credit information system to help banks extend credit to broader sections of society, the Credit Bureau Act was submitted to parliament in February 2014 and the government expects it to be enacted by November 2015 to ensure that credit information sharing will protect the privacy rights of individuals.Private investment and growth are hampered by impediments in the legal framework for creditorsÔøΩ rights and contract enforcement, barriers to new business start-ups, complex legal, taxation and border trade requirements, and impaired access to finance.

The move took effect Monday.""While additional RRR cuts were expected throughout 2015, the size and timing of this cut indicates leaders are more deeply concerned about the state of the economy than official comments previously indicated,"" said Brian Jackson, China economist at IHS Global Insight.Jackson noted it was the largest RRR reduction since November 2008 amid the global financial crisis.Lifted in early trade by the Chinese action, prices retraced some gains after Saudi ArabiaÔøΩs oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, pointed to strong crude production, only for prices to rise again on a bullish forecast for US inventories.""ItÔøΩs been choppy,"" said John Kilduff of Again Capital.Investors, he said, are ""trying to determine when the production tide is going to turn"" in the United States, which has been pumping out historic amounts of crude despite a global supply glut.Kilduff said a report by energy information company Genscape, showing that crude reserves at the key storage hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, had fallen by 900,000 barrels, had boosted trader sentiment.Dealers are also reading a drop in US oil rig activity as a sign of a production slowdown that could alleviate the global oversupply and push up prices that have halved since mid-2014.""There may be scope for oil prices to be lifted further in the near term both by falling US oil output and crude stock data, and by better news on the demand side from the economies of the US, eurozone and China,"" said Julian Jessop, head of commodities research at Capital Economics.

"MilanÔøΩs Expo 2015 opened on Friday with hopes the six-month food-themed world fair will be a catalyst for economic revival competing with fears it will simply underline ItalyÔøΩs deep-seated problems.The first global exhibition since ShanghaiÔøΩs groundbreaking hosting five years ago has been beset by delays and the site was far from fully completed as the first visitors streamed in at 0800 GMT.Corruption scandals, fears of violent protests and evidence of a fledgling economic recovery running out of steam have all dampened the mood in the run-up to the event.But Italy is a master at delivering at the 11th hour -- the finishing touches to some of the stadiums for the 1990 World Cup came within minutes of kick-off.And a spectacular eve-of-opening concert, featuring tenor Andrea Bocelli, Chinese pianist Lang Lang and the choir and opera of the cityÔøΩs renowned La Scala opera house performing in front of MilanÔøΩs magnificent Gothic cathedral, was a reminder of the countryÔøΩs capacity to compensate with creativity for its shortcomings in the more humdrum aspects of event planning.Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has been bullishly predicting that it will all be alright on the night, facing down the opponents who say a state with ItalyÔøΩs unsustainable debt should not be ploughing money into an event that is, by definition, ephemeral in nature.Those opponents are due to stage a major march on Friday and fears of a spillover into violence were raised by incidents on the eve of the opening, when a few dozen masked protestors attempted to spray-paint and smash the windows of a branch of Manpower, an employment agency that is one of the official partners of the Expo.- Milan seeking reinvention -Italy secured the rights to host the Expo seven years ago, long before Renzi came to power last year. But he has embraced it as an opportunity for Italy to show the world that it is reinventing itself under his leadership.The event plays to ItalyÔøΩs strengths with its nutrition and gastronomy-based theme of ""Feeding the Planet, Energy for Life.""Organisers are predicting 20 million visitors over six months and a 10-billion-euro boost to economic activity through increased tourist revenues and other, harder to measure, benefits such as increased investment.More than a million Chinese are expected to visit Milan for the Expo and Italian officials are hoping some of them will become long-term business partners as the economic relationship between the two countries flourishes.For Milan, the Expo is also about reinvention with the city seeking to forge a new image as a 21st Century ""smart"" city that is defined as much by its flair for gastronomy, design and sustainable living as by its industrial past.There will be tight airport-style security around the site and a huge police presence on Friday in anticipation of the ""No Expo"" movementÔøΩs march.Earlier this week, police carried out pre-emptive raids on radical groups suspected of planning to ensure the demonstration turns into a showdown with the security forces.Officers seized fireworks, baseball bats, gas masks and material which could be used to make Molotov cocktails.The organisers of FridayÔøΩs demonstration have insisted it will be peaceful and accuse the police and media of whipping up public alarm because they are fearful that there will be more people protesting than visiting the Expo.The ExpoÔøΩs critics have focused on the conditions of some of the 6,000 employees who have been engaged on a work experience basis, as well as the involvement of corporations such as McDonalds and Coca Cola, saying that has stripped the event of any environmental credibility.

"Oil prices edged higher on Tuesday as the market seeks to build on strong gains in April following massive falls earlier in the year.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in June won 56 cents to $59.49 a barrel.Brent North Sea crude for June won 47 cents to stand at $66.93 a barrel in London midday deals.After slumping at the start of the year, oil prices rose by about a fifth in value during April owing to several factors including concerns about unrest in Yemen, the weakening dollar and fewer US rigs in operation, analysts said.However, prices remain well down after plunging almost 60 percent between June and the start of 2015 on the back of a global supply glut and ramped up production.""Crude oil producers in the US have significantly cut back output in an attempt to address the significant supply overhang which has exerted downward pressure on... prices since June last year,"" Kash Kamal, senior research analyst at Sucden brokers said on Tuesday.The International Monetary Fund has said that Gulf oil exporters must reduce spending, including subsidies, and diversify their economies to cope with lower revenues caused by the sharp drop in crude prices.The wealthy monarchies, however, should ""not react in a knee-jerk way to lower oil prices"", the IMF Middle East and Central Asia chief Masood Ahmed told AFP in an interview Monday.""Saudi Arabia seem committed to defending their market share and have even increased output to over 10 million barrels per day in April,"" said Kamal.""Support for higher crude prices has partly come from a weaker dollar,"" he added.A weaker dollar makes oil priced in the US unit cheaper for holders of others currencies, boosting demand.

"Gulf oil exporters must reduce spending, including subsidies, and diversify their economies to cope with lower revenues caused by the sharp drop in crude prices, the International Monetary Fund said.The wealthy monarchies, however, should ""not react in a knee-jerk way to lower oil prices"", the IMF Middle East and Central Asia chief Masood Ahmed told AFP in an interview Monday.They would be better off to ""adjust gradually"" using the large financial reserves they have accumulated during several years of bumper oil receipts, he said in Dubai. But as oil prices have dropped lower than budgeted breakeven levels, ""it is important that they gradually, but in a determined way... reduce their spending (and) consolidate their fiscal position,"" Ahmed said.Oil prices have shed half of their value since June 2014, and are expected to be lower than the breakeven point for Gulf countries in the next three to four years.The Gulf Cooperation Council includes Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates -- economies all heavily dependent on energy revenues. A combined budget surplus for 2014 of $76 billion (68.5 billion euros) is expected to turn into a deficit of $113 billion this year, the IMF said in its latest regional report. ""They need to act to reinforce their efforts to diversify their economies to become less dependent on oil,"" said Ahmed, pointing out that many have already taken such measures.""The UAE is more advanced in terms of diversification. The others also are in varying degrees trying to encourage private sector activity outside the oil area."" - Curb subsidies -GCC countries were also urged to cut energy subsidies in a bid to minimise public spending and trigger a change in consumer behaviour.""Most GCC countries still have the domestic sale price for energy products below the international prices... We think that over time it is important to tackle the issue of energy subsidies to reduce them,"" Ahmed said.Gulf states should also contain salary growth in the public sector, which usually employs nationals as opposed to the private sector that depends on millions of foreigners.In addition, GCC countries would need to prioritise investment projects that ""most advance the development agenda,"" said Ahmed.Oil-export revenues for GCC countries are forecast to be $280 billion lower this year than a year ago.With the exception of gas-rich Qatar and Kuwait, all GCC states are expected to face budget deficits this year, said Ahmed, adding this could persist for two or three years.""The important thing to recognise is that GCC countries have built up financial buffers that put them in a very strong position to be able to use these savings to finance expenditure and to have a gradual decrease in spending over the coming years,"" he said.This in turn would minimise the economic impact of the drop in oil prices. GCC states are estimated to have foreign reserves of about $2.5 trillion.""The impact on (economic) growth is quite limited,"" said Ahmed.The IMF has forecast GCC countries to grow as a group at 3.4 percent in 2015, one percent down from earlier predictions, mainly because of a slowdown in non-oil growth in response to lower oil prices.",other

"Following its approval from National Assembly, the lower house of the parliament, the upper house Senate on Wednesday also passed the Gas Infrastructure Development Cess (GIDC) bill 2015 amid protest from some opposition members.During the discussion, members of opposition parties criticized the government for presenting the bill in the house and urged that it should be presented in Council of Common Interest (CCI) for consultation with the provinces before its passage. Senator Tahir Hussain Mashhadi of MQM said that the the bill should have been presented in the CCI. He said any tax on natural resources cannot be imposed without consultation of provinces, he said.Senator Nauman Wazir and Sentor Saleem Mandviwala called for need to find a mechansim of gas infrastructure development and suggested that concerns of opposition should also be addressed.Opposition Leader Aitzaz Ahsan and Senators including Usman Saifullah, Mohsin Aziz, Shahi Syed, Saeed Ghani, Usman Kakar, Sassui Paleejo, Robina Adnan, Naseema Ehsan and Mohsin Leghari registered their opposing comments on the bill during discussion.Opposition members belonging to Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), Awami National Party (ANP) and Balochistan National Awami Party staged a token walk out from the House.Earlier, Minister for Petroleum and Natural Resources Shahid Khaqan Abbasi in his winding up speech said National Assembly has already passed the Bill and said the government requires Rs1000 billion annually to maintain and improve gas infrastructure in the country.He said that Rs100 billion would be collated annually through this levy and it would be used for gas infrastructure and added that no province is self-sufficient in gas.He said that the production of gas is 4 BCFD and demand is 8 BCFD adding that it is very necessary to fund some important projects.He said that TAPI is Rs1 trillion project but our share is of Rs100 billion.The minister said that the collection amount of GIDC would not be misused and the parliament would oversee it.Shahid Khaqan said that the CCI itself says that the GIDC does not come into its domain and federal government should settle it. He said that Supreme Court has already decided that it is not a tax but a cess.Defending further the Cess Bill, he argued that to bridge the widening gas supply gap a number of gas import projects were being perused including the Iran-Pakistan (IP) gas pipeline project, Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) pipeline project, LNG import projects and LPG supply enhancement project in public as well as private sectors.He said that in case the required infrastructure was not developed for the above mentioned projects the government would be forced to import liquefied fuels which are much costlier as compared to gas.Further Pakistan would also be exposed to payment of liquidated damages or payments. According to him presently neither the federal government nor any gas utility has adequate funding to implement the above project.To create the required infrastructure it was therefore necessary that a new Cess may be imposed.He also accepted the idea of some opposition Senators for forming a committee to point out anomalies in the bill, which would prepare its recommendations to make the bill more beneficial.The minister went on to say that it would be the current government, which has planned to provide gas to every district of BalochistanÔøΩ APP/Geo News ",other

"Chinese Premier Li Keqiang lifted the wraps Tuesday on a multibillion-dollar series of trade and investment deals with Brazil, as Beijing looks to invest $53 billion in South AmericaÔøΩs largest economy.The news unveiled at the start of LiÔøΩs first official visit to Latin America is a huge boon for Brazil as it endures a fifth straight year of low growth after a period of rapid expansion fueled by Asian demand for commodities that has since slowed.LiÔøΩs host, President Dilma Rousseff, hopes Brazil can direct Chinese cash to overhaul decaying infrastructure as the countryÔøΩs tourist magnet Rio de Janeiro prepares to host South AmericaÔøΩs first ever Olympics next year.Headlining 35 deals on LiÔøΩs first official visit to Latin America were a pair of finance and cooperation agreements worth $7 billion for BrazilÔøΩs state-owned oil firm Petrobras.Rousseff, who will make a state visit next year to China, spoke of a ""new intensity in our relations.""""China and Brazil are playing a leading role in the construction of a new global order,"" she added.Rousseff, re-elected in October, has been battling a welter of negative economic data as well as fallout from a huge graft scandal at Petrobras.Li pointed to ChinaÔøΩs ""rich experience"" in building infrastructure, saying Beijing ""would like to cooperate with Brazil in reducing its costs.""Despite a multibillion-dollar kickbacks scandal battering its reputation as BrazilÔøΩs flagship company, Petrobras had earlier this year received another Beijing boost in signing a $3.5 billion financing deal with the China Investment Bank.Despite becoming BrazilÔøΩs number one trading partner in 2009, amid an exponential rise in two-way trade, China currently ranks only 12th in terms of actual investment in Brazil, prompting Brasilia to seek deeper economic ties.The Chinese are notably supplying new metro trains and catamarans to Rio and Li will visit the Olympic host city Wednesday to inspect those investments before leaving Thursday for Colombia ahead of trips to Peru and Chile.LiÔøΩs tour, aimed at underpinning growing Chinese influence in Latin America, comes just days after Beijing signed accords worth $25 billion and $22 billion respectively with fellow BRICS developing nations Russia. But the Brazil package is worth more than those combined.- Air deals, railroad dreams -Aside from the Petrobras agreements, Rousseff and Li also signed a range of deals designed to further bilateral cooperation on trade, investment, agriculture, energy and transport.Brasilia and Beijing also finalised a $1.3 billion accord to sell 22 Brazilian Embraer commercial jets to ChinaÔøΩs Tianjin Airlines, Embraer said.BrazilÔøΩs Vale, the worldÔøΩs biggest iron producer, announced a range of deals including extended cooperation with China on maritime transport of iron ore.Among the deals, Vale said it would expand an existing accord by selling four ore carriers to China Merchants Energy Shipping Co. Ltd and also also signed a memorandum of understanding with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China for up to $4 billion in loans and other financial arrangements.China also vowed to lift an import ban on Brazilian beef and signed onto an ambitious project to build a railway from the key southeastern Brazilian port of Santos more than 3,500 kilometers (2,200 miles) to the Peruvian Pacific port of Ilo.- Exponential growth -Bilateral trade between the BRICS developing states has mushroomed over the past decade, with the Asian giant becoming BrazilÔøΩs main trading partner in 2009.Trade between China and Latin America as a whole exploded from barely $10 billion in 2000 to $255.5 billion in 2012.Sino-Brazilian trade mushroomed from $6.5 billion in 2003 to $83.3 billion in 2012.Ahead of LiÔøΩs arrival late Monday, Jose Graca Lima, head of Asian affairs in the Brazilian foreign ministry, explained that a ""second generation"" of Chinese investment is underway, switching from trade in raw materials to heavy industry and infrastructure.Facilitating the movement of imports from Brazil -- and similarly that of its own exports to Latin America -- is a key Chinese aim, pushing their interest in funding the mooted $10 billion railway project through to Peru.Building the rail link would mean that ""a new path to Asia will open up for Brazil, reducing distances and costs,"" Rousseff told reporters.

"Oil prices fell in Asia Monday after OPEC decided to maintain its high output levels, while traders were also weighing the possible return of Iranian supplies that have been curtailed by international sanctions against Tehran, analysts said. US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for July delivery fell 59 cents to $58.54 while Brent crude for July eased 56 cents to $62.75 in mid-morning trade. Analysts said investors were mulling the long-term impact on prices after the 12-nation Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) on Friday defied calls to cut output to alleviate a global supply glut that has seen prices slump almost 50 percent over the past year. Instead, they kept their collective target at 30 million barrels per day -- where it has stood for more than three and a half years.OPEC countries are reported to be actually pumping more than 31 million barrels a day, with the risk of more coming on line.Sanjeev Gupta, head of the Asia-Pacific oil and gas practice at business consultancy firm EY, said prices are ""likely to remain volatile"" ahead of a June 30 deadline for Iran and world powers to come to an agreement on curbing TehranÔøΩs nuclear programme.Six global powers -- Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States -- are trying to nail down a deal to curb IranÔøΩs nuclear ambitions by reducing its stockpiles of enriched uranium and mothballing some of its sites.If the agreement is reached and implemented, the powers have agreed to gradually scale back sanctions imposed since 2012, including on its petroleum industry. Iran has the worldÔøΩs fourth-largest oil reserves but its exports have fallen from more than 2.2 million barrels per day in 2011 to about 1.3 million because of the sanctions. ""Any likelihood of a deal could act as a trigger for downward movement of crude prices,"" said Gupta. (AFP) ",other
"Foreigners working in the energy-rich Arab states of the Gulf sent more than $100 billion in remittances to their home countries last year, an economic report showed Tuesday.The figure was twice as high as remittances in 2010, an indication of strong growth, the head of economic research at Kuwait Financial Center (Markaz), Raghu Mandagoathur, said in the report.Around 25 million expats live in the Gulf Cooperation Council states -- Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates -- equal to the native population.The remittances are estimated at 6.2 percent of the combined GDP of the six GCC states of $1.6 trillion, the report said, citing IMF and World Bank figures.In comparison, foreigners in the United States and Britain sent home just 0.7 percent and 0.8 percent of GDP, respectively, it said.Saudi Arabia topped the list with its estimated 10 million expats sending home $44 billion, followed by UAE with 29 billion.Remittances from Kuwait and Qatar were $12 billion and $9.5 billion, respectively, while smaller transfers were made out of Oman and Bahrain, the report said.The majority of Gulf expatriates originate from India, Egypt, the Philippines, Bangladesh and Pakistan, as well as Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Yemen.The report attributed the high level of remittances to curbs applied by GCC states on foreign ownership and investment.And unlike in Western countries, foreigners have no hope of acquiring citizenship in GCC states regardless of the duration of residence.The report advised GCC states to encourage expatriates to invest by launching specialised services and opening up their markets to foreign residents, especially the real estate sector.",other

"China's tumbling stock market showed signs of seizing up on Wednesday, as companies scrambled to escape the rout by having their shares suspended and indexes plunged after the securities regulator warned of ""panic sentiment"" gripping investors.Beijing, which has struggled for more than a week to bend the market to its will, unveiled yet another battery of measures to arrest the sell-off, and the People's Bank of China said it would step up support to brokerages enlisted to prop up shares.The CSI300 index of the largest listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen closed down 6.8 percent, while the Shanghai Composite Index dropped 5.9 percent.With nearly half the market on a trading halt and another round of margin calls forcing leveraged investors to dump whatever shares could find a buyer, blue chips that had been supported by stabilisation funds earlier in the week bore the brunt.""I've never seen this kind of slump before. I don't think anyone has. Liquidity is totally depleted,"" said Du Changchun, an analyst at Northeast Securities.""Originally, many wanted to hold blue chips. But since so many small caps are suspended from trading, the only way to reduce risk exposure is to sell blue chips.""More than 30 percent has been knocked off the value of Chinese shares since mid-June, and for some global investors the fear that China's market turmoil will destabilise the real economy is now a bigger risk than the crisis in Greece.""Also, the ripple effect from the market correction has yet to show up,"" wrote Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts in a note. ""We expect slower growth, poorer corporate earnings, and a higher risk of a financial crisis.""Commodities markets reflected growing concerns about the broader health of the world's second largest economy, with copper prices falling to a six-year low, Shanghai nickel futures sliding by their 5 percent daily limit, and oil falling towards $56 a barrel, near a three month-low.TRADING HALTSMore than 500 China-listed firms announced trading halts on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges on Wednesday, taking total suspensions to about 1,300 - 45 percent of the market or roughly $2.4 trillion worth of stock - as companies scuttled to sit out the carnage.With so many small-cap companies sheltering on the sidelines, the ChiNext growth board, which has seen some of the biggest swings in valuations, fell a modest 0.8 percent.The plunge in China's previously booming stock markets, which had more than doubled in the year to mid-June, is a major headache for President Xi Jinping and China's top leaders, who are already grappling with slowing growth.Beijing's interventionist response has also raised questions about its ability to enact the market liberalisation steps that are a centrepiece of its economic reform agenda.China has orchestrated brokerages and fund managers to promise to buy billions of dollars' worth of stocks, helped by a state-backed margin finance company which the central bank pledged on Wednesday to provide sufficient liquidity.The securities regulator said the Securities Finance Corp had provided 260 billion yuan ($41.8 billion) to 21 brokerages, though that sum is only 40 percent of the amount of leveraged positions that investors have cut since June 18.RETAIL INVESTORSUnlike other major stock markets, which are dominated by professional money managers, retail investors account for around 85 percent of China trade, which exacerbates volatility.""It's uncommon to see so many shares posting consecutive daily limit falls, and the index futures swinging so wildly,"" said Wang Feng, CEO and founder of hedge fund firm Alpha Squared Capital Co and a former Wall Street trader.""It's a stampede. And the problem of the market is that all the players move in the same direction, and are too emotional.""A surprise interest-rate cut by the central bank at the end of June, relaxations in margin trading and other ""stability measures"" have done little to calm investors.The barrage of official commentary and new support measures continued throughout Wednesday's trading session, without visible effect.Deng Ge, a spokesman for the China Securities Regulatory Commission, said in remarks posted on its official channel on Weibo, China's version of Twitter, that there had been a big increase in ""irrational selling"" of stocks.Government agencies also announced that insurers would be allowed to by more blue chips and urged major shareholders and top executives to buy their own shares.But the market sell-off has extended beyond the mainland, with Chinese stocks on US exchanges falling as much as 6.1 percent on Tuesday, according to the Bank of New York Mellon index of such securities.Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 5.8 percent, with shares of Chinese brokerages taking a heavy beating.""Investors are extremely unimpressed with their sudden conscription into national service, and you can see that in their share prices,"" said Matthew Smith, a strategist who covers the China financials sector for Macquarie.",other
"The International Monetary Fund lowered its 2015 global economic growth forecast on Thursday, citing a likely ""temporary setback"" from the United States in the first months of the year.The IMF also highlighted the risk of ""financial stress"" in Europe from the Greek debt crisis and ChinaÔøΩs slowdown, but left forecasts for the eurozone and the Asian giant unchanged.The Washington-based institution projected the world economy would grow 3.3 percent this year, less than the 3.5 percent pace it had forecast in April and slightly slower than 2014. The 2016 forecast was for a pick-up to 3.8 percent.""Moderate growth continues, with an improving recovery in advanced economies, and a slowdown in underlying growth in emerging-market and low-income developing economies,"" said Olivier Blanchard, the IMFÔøΩs chief economist, at a news conference.According to the IMF, the downgrade of the global growth forecast largely reflects the contraction in the US economy in the first quarter amid severe winter weather, which spilled over to neighboring Canada and Mexico.""The unexpected weakness in North America, which accounts for the lionÔøΩs share of the growth forecast revision in advanced economies, is likely to prove a temporary setback,"" it said.Because of the setback, the IMF lowered its forecast for the United States, the worldÔøΩs largest economy, by 0.6 percentage point to 2.5 percent. CanadaÔøΩs forecast was cut by 0.7 point to 1.5 percent, and MexicoÔøΩs by 0.6 point to 2.4 percent.Blanchard said that the US economyÔøΩs soft first quarter, a 0.2 percent contraction, turned out to not be a sign of underlying weakness ""now that the fog has largely cleared.""""Fundamentals are still solid, and the US recovery is on track,"" he said.GreeceÔøΩs debt crisis, which could force it to abandon the euro, for the moment only was having a marginal effect on the expansion of the global economy, the IMF said in the update of its World Economic Outlook.The institution left unchanged its forecasts for the eurozone at 1.5 percent, and for the two largest economies: Germany (1.6 percent) and France (1.2 percent).""Developments in Greece have, so far, not resulted in any significant contagion. Timely policy action should help to manage such risks if they were to materialize,"" it said, noting the recovery in the eurozone seemed ""broadly on track"".But the recent rise in interest rates on the sovereign bonds in some euro area economies could signal larger problems ahead. ""Some risks of a reemergence of financial stress remain,"" it said.- China outlook unchanged -The 188-nation IMF also left unchanged its forecast for China (6.8 percent) despite the turbulence in its capital markets.""The puncture of what had clearly become a stock market bubble may have some limited effect on spending. But, for the moment, the slowdown in growth is primarily led by a slowdown in real estate investment, a development we see as basically desirable,"" Blanchard said.""There is no particular reason to have lost confidence"" in ChinaÔøΩs economy because of the bursting bubble, he added.Japan, the worldÔøΩs number-three economy, had some drag from sluggish consumption and wage growth, the IMF said, lowering its forecast by 0.2 point to 0.8 percent.Slowing growth in emerging market and developing economies was also holding back momentum in the global economy.The IMF said the contraction in Brazil, Latin AmericaÔøΩs largest economy, would be worse than previously thought; it expects the economy to shrink by 1.5 percent this year.But the outlook for Russia, also in recession, was improved, with a 3.4 percent contraction expected after improvements in commodity prices and confidence.Risks to growth remained tilted to the downside, it said, including spillovers to economic activity from heightened geopolitical tensions in Ukraine, the Middle East and Africa.Given these uncertainties, the IMF was waiting for better growth in 2016, estimated at 3.8 percent, but showed caution.""The projected pickup in global growth, while still expected, has not yet firmly materialized,"" it said.

"Sindh Board of Revenue (SBR) has confirmed a fraudulent transaction worth Rs500 million between Aqeel Karim Dhedhi (AKD) and Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL) while National Accountability Bureau (FBR) has launched an investigation into the scam.In a shady transaction, a piece of land was acquired in 2010 by PPL through the real estate company of AKD at higher than market rate that caused a huge loss of Rs500 million to the countryÔøΩs exchequer.Sindh Board of Revenue (SBR) confirmed fraud in the above transaction in its report filed with the NAB.A social worker named Waqas Ahmed had contacted the NAB and informed it about the transaction in question that took place on July 15, 2010.According to Waqas Ahmed, PPL bought the piece of land measuring 35009 sq ft through AKDÔøΩs real estate company at a rate of Rs175,000 per sq ft with the total amount of transaction hitting Rs1.2124 billion.Ahmed said the government rate for the land was Rs34,500 per sq ft and market rate was between Rs100,000 and Rs125,000.He said in order to allow illegal profit to the seller, 40 percent higher rate was paid for the land, causing a loss of Rs500 million to the national exchequer.When no action was taken after Waqas AhmedÔøΩs contact with NAB, he approached Sindh High Court (SHC) on November 10, 2014.On this, NAB came up with an assurance to the SHC of taking action and began investigation into the matter.

The International Energy Agency meanwhile forecast that global oil demand growth would slow in 2016 and that oil production in nations outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would stall.In its first estimates for 2016, the IEA forecast that oil demand would slow next year to 1.2 million barrels per day, compared with an average of 1.4 million barrels per day this year.Meanwhile growth in non-OPEC oil supply ""is expected to grind to a halt in 2016 as lower oil prices and spending cuts take a toll"", the IEA said in its monthly oil report.In trading Friday, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in August climbed 42 cents to $53.20 a barrel compared with ThursdayÔøΩs close.Brent North Sea crude for August advanced 62 cents to stand at $59.23 a barrel in London afternoon deals.- Chinese turbulence -US crude futures had sunk nearly eight percent Monday on worries about slowing global growth, as Greek voters rejected a bailout offer and China moved to calm financial market turbulence.""There are some signs that foreign investors are more optimistic about ChinaÔøΩs efforts to arrest the stock slide,"" said Bernard Aw, market strategist at IG Markets.""However, I feel much caution should be exercised and it is important to observe the Chinese markets in the coming sessions before calling it a bottom.""Aw added: ""As we have seen in the past, Chinese equities may recover in one session, only to fall straight back into a downward spiral the next day.""Chinese stocks surged for a second day on Friday as a government rescue plan offered a respite from a month-long rout.In a rollercoaster week, the Shanghai market gained 5.18 percent overall, after the government announced additional policies to avoid a market crash.But it is still down 24.9 percent from its closing peak on June 12.

"The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Thursday stressed upon removing structural rigidities of various economic sectors, especially the export sector, in order to shift reliance from debt inflows for the financing of current account deficit and building up of foreign exchange reserves.ÔøΩThe first and foremost, exports, the prime source of foreign exchange earnings for the country, have been stagnant in the recent past, and declined during July-March (period) of FY15,ÔøΩ the central bank said in its latest report covering economic performance during the third quarter (January-March 2015) of the last fiscal year that ended on June 30, 2015.The report emphasized that as the non-debt inflows remained subdued, the country has to rely on debt inflows for the financing of current account deficit, and building up of liquid FX reserves.Moreover, it said net foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows, though maintained the last yearÔøΩs level, could not match the outflow under repatriation of profits/dividends while the modest growth in tax collections continued to be a challenge.Referring to the external sector, it said the sector improved considerably due to (a) the current account, benefiting from a robust growth in workersÔøΩ remittances, higher inflows under Coalition Support Fund, and a sharp reduction in oil prices, posted a notable surplus in Q3-FY15; and (b) the SBPÔøΩs liquid FX reserves more than doubled the level seen a year ago, enough to finance three months of the countryÔøΩs import bill.The resulting stability in the exchange rate, together with the government decision to pass-on the benefit of fall in international oil prices to domestic consumers and the prudent monetary management, not only pushed YoY CPI inflation down to a decadeÔøΩs low.The report added that the budget deficit during July-March FY15 slightly narrowed to 3.8 percent of GDP, compared with 3.9 percent in the same period last year. FBR tax collections grew by 12.7 percent during Jul-Mar FY15, which were well below the 17.9 percent growth recorded in Jul-Mar FY14. Overall expenditures grew by 8.3 percent during Jul-Mar FY15, against 8.7 percent in the same period FY14. According to the report, the financing of budget deficit indicates that the government did not resort to inflationary borrowing from SBP; instead, it returned a huge sum of Rs 674.4 billion (on cash basis) during July-March FY15.As a result, the government was not only able to contain its borrowing from SBP within the IMF ceiling for end-March 2015, but also met the limit of zero quarterly borrowing prescribed in the SBP Act, 1956.The report also noted that the real GDP grew by 4.24 percent in FY15. Though it was the highest since FY08, it fell short of 5.1 percent target for the year, as most of the challenges to economic activity continued to persist. Agriculture sector posted a slightly higher growth (2.9 percent) in FY15, compared with 2.7 percent in FY14. Large scale manufacturing (LSM) grew by 2.5 percent during Jul-Mar FY15, compared with the 4.6 percent growth during the same period last year.

"Pakistan's car market has been dominated by Japanese automakers for decades, but a mini-economic revival looks set to attract new players from Europe and Korea into the mix.Despite heavy taxation on imported vehicles, enthusiasm for owning a car in Pakistan has remained undented ÔøΩ thanks in part to underdeveloped public transport in the countryÔøΩs sprawling cities, but also the social status it brings.Toyota, Suzuki and Honda car assembly plants already work around the clock in the southern port city of Karachi and eastern Lahore ÔøΩ yet customers can still wait for up to four months for new vehicles to be delivered.Now demand for cars in the South Asian giant of 200 million people is accelerating even more quickly, as economic growth has reached its fastest pace since 2008 while renewed investor confidence and easing inflation have spurred consumer spending.Keen to cash in, a delegation from German auto giant Volkswagen visited the country in recent weeks, according to Pakistani officials and German diplomats.Company spokesman Christoph Adomat told AFP that while ""Volkswagen is constantly evaluating market opportunities on a worldwide basis... there are no decisions for an investment from Volkswagen side in Pakistan"".Miftah Ismail, the chairman of Pakistan Board of Investment who took part in the talks, said Volkswagen was not the only company expressing an interest.

The most popular Corolla 1.3 sedan starts at 1.6 million rupees ($16,000), but buyers have to wait months or pay $1,500 for prompt delivery.The news that Volkswagen was exploring options to enter the Pakistani market has excited car enthusiasts, who are tired of high prices and limited choices.""I think it is a great idea because Volkswagen cars are value for money and reliability,"" said Romano Karim, a fan of the classic Volkswagen Beetles from the 60s and 70s that can often be seen on PakistanÔøΩs roads.Haji Mohammad Shahzad, chairman of the All Pakistan Motor Dealers Association, added that having Volkswagen in the market would help drive costs down.""The monopoly of big three could be broken if Volkswagen produces at least 20,000-25,000 cars annually,"" Shahzad told AFP.Renewed confidenceGlobal auto giants are attracted by PakistanÔøΩs booming economy, which the International Monetary Fund predicts will grow by 4.5 percent in the next financial year. Investor confidence in the medium-sized economy of $232 billion has improved since a new business-friendly government led by Nawaz Sharif took power in 2013, with KarachiÔøΩs share market among the worldÔøΩs top 10 performers in the past year.The country is also undergoing a major construction boom driven by Chinese investment after President Xi Jinping visited Islamabad in April to unveil a $46 billion investment plan known as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.Car sales have also boomed thanks to the growth of car leasing and financing facilities. Sales in the 11 months to May this year rose 30 percent from a year earlier, according to industry group the Pakistan Automotive Manufacturers Association.Baber Kaleem Khan, editor of PakWheels.com magazine, said Volkswagen would be well poised to tap into the lower to mid-range market.""Pakistani automakers havenÔøΩt really had much competition because their respective domains are well protected by monopolistic business practices,"" Khan told AFP.""But given VWÔøΩs impressive small-range of vehicles, the German automaker can take the market from the ground up and start working to the top.""",other

"Gold hovered near a 5-1/2-year low on Wednesday as the dollar strengthened after comments from a Federal Reserve official backed expectations that the U.S. central bank would hike interest rates as early as next month.Atlanta Federal Reserve President Dennis Lockhart has said it would take ""significant deterioration"" in the U.S. economy for him to not support a rate hike in September, according to the Wall Street Journal.Gold, an asset that does not earn interest, has taken a hit given rising risks of a US rate hike.

"Desperate to widen the tax base in a country where less then one percent of the population pay taxes, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has set a target to collect 138,000 more returns during the tax year 2015, officials said on Friday. The FBR has fixed a target of 1.05 million income tax returns during the year due to higher tax rates on non-filers. The FBR last year received 0.912 million tax returns. A senior official at Directorate of Broadening of Tax Base (BTB) of FBR said the FBR was estimating over 100,000 new income tax returns to be filed by the taxpayers during tax year 2015. The return filing for tax year 2015 will be completed by December with the filing by corporate sector. The filing of income tax returns for the tax year 2014 has been increased after measures taken in the budget 2015/2016 and it has increased to 912,000. The total number is still low as 3.5 million registered taxpayers are in the country. The directorate has gathered details of transactions on which tax was paid during 2013/2014 for the purposes of bringing new taxpayers in the system. According to details, Rs19.75 billion was collected from 2.46 million commercial and 0.29 million industrial electricity consumers. Similarly, about Rs52 billion of taxes were collected through withholding mechanism from 136.5 million mobile phone and 5.6 million landline telephone subscribers. In the banking system the FBR recorded 30.5 million transactions including saving accounts, national saving schemes and cash withdrawals on which the tax authorities collected over Rs50 billion. The directorate so far issued 344,572 notices to defaulters. Around 72,000 persons filed returns and paid Rs485 million tax. Through those notices, the directorate created demand of Rs16.87 billion and recovered Rs6.42 billion. During the recovery process the tax authorities resorted to harsh measures in 2,326 cases, which included: freezing of 1,366 bank accounts; issued arrest warrant in 343 cases; attached 195 properties and impounded 422 vehicles.

"Oil prices fell in Asian trade on Monday, extending weeks of losses after a US report stoked expectations of a global glut of suppliers.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for September delivery was at $43.57, down from $43.87 on Friday in New York -- its lowest close since March 17.Brent crude for September was trading at $48.25 after ending at $48.61 on Friday""ItÔøΩs still a supply story,"" Jonathan Barratt, chief investment officer at Ayers Alliance Securities, told Bloomberg News.""There is not a lot of upside for oil.""Concerns about a global supply glut were stoked on Friday when Baker Hughes said the number of US drilling rigs rose for the third straight week.The count rose to 670, the oil-field services firm reported -- its fifth weekly gain in six -- just days after the US government reported an increase in oil production in the worldÔøΩs top consumer.A glut in crude oil supply is seen as the main driver for a sharp decline in oil prices that has seen crude slump to almost a third of its mid-2014 peaks.News of rising US production comes as top producing cartel OPEC has refused to cut output, and as investors wait for Iran to ramp up exports after a major deal over its nuclear programme last month.In exchange for curbing its nuclear activities, Tehran will see the lifting of sanctions, which have slashed its oil exports.Investors predict crude prices will remain under pressure for the rest of the year, particularly after trade and inflation data added to concerns about ChinaÔøΩs economy over the weekend.""WeÔøΩre expecting oil prices not to recover at all in the second-half,"" Mark Pervan, head commodity research at AustraliaÔøΩs ANZ bank, told Bloomberg.

Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has announced August 31 as last date for salaried persons and September 30 for non salaried persons to file their tax returns.The deadlines for filing the tax returns is for all existing and new tax filers an official of FBR told APP here on Tuesday.He said the FBR was committed to broadening the tax net for strengthening of the national economy and to enhance tax to GDP ratio.The official said that FBR had collected Rs 140 billion during first month of current fiscal year 2015-16.

"ChinaÔøΩs central bank on Tuesday devalued its yuan currency by nearly two percent against the US dollar, as authorities seek to push market reforms and bolster the worldÔøΩs second-largest economy.The surprise move marked the biggest drop since China reformed its currency system in 2005 by unpegging the yuan -- also known as the renminbi (RMB) -- from the greenback.It should make the countryÔøΩs exports more competitive overseas, but analysts said it could prompt anger in the US.The PeopleÔøΩs Bank of China (PBoC) set its daily reference rate for the yuan at 6.2298 to $1, compared with 6.1162 yuan the previous day, effectively 1.86 percent lower.The change came amid speculation China is preparing to widen the yuanÔøΩs two percent trading band for the first time since March 2014.The range is calculated from a central ""reference rate"" each day. Before Tuesday, Chinese officials said they based the fixing on a poll of market-makers, but the PBoCÔøΩs move means it will now also take into account the previous dayÔøΩs close and other factors.Beijing has so far kept a tight grip on the currencyÔøΩs value on fears major swings and volatile capital flows could present financial risk and reduce its control over the economy.That has made the yuan far more stable than other major global currencies and a two percent move in its value is dramatic -- before TuesdayÔøΩs announcement it had traded within a roughly 0.4 percent band for four months.

"Oil prices fell in Asia Tuesday as dealers focused on an upcoming US energy report for clues about production and demand levels in the worldÔøΩs top crude consumer amid abundant global supplies.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for September delivery fell 47 cents to $44.49 while Brent crude for September eased 45 cents to $49.96 in mid-morning trade.The US Energy Information Administration will release the latest US stockpiles report for the week to August 7 on Wednesday.Analysts said dealers will focus on production after it rose 52,000 in the previous week, slightly offsetting a 4.4 million drop in overall crude reserves that indicated healthy demand.London-based research house Capital Economics said the main drivers pressuring oil prices were ""signs of a recovery in US production and buoyant OPEC supply"".Dealers predict a slowdown in US output -- and increased demand during the summer driving season -- could whittle down a huge global glut that has been a key reason prices collapsed from a peak of around $120 in June last year.The Organisation of the Petroleum Export CountriesÔøΩ (OPEC) decision to maintain its output level at around 30 million barrels a day despite sagging demand is also seen as a reason for the abundant supplies.The move is seen as an attempt by the producer cartelÔøΩs kingpin Saudi Arabia to defend its market share as it fends off competition from US shale oil.That policy may be working, with the latest drop in prices prompting ""more Western oil companies to shelve investment plans, which will feed back into slower growth in non-OPEC production,"" Capital Economics said.

"In a bid to increase the number of income tax returns, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has made mandatory for all salaried persons having taxable income to file income tax returns electronically from Tax Year 2015.Through SRO 791(I)/2015 issued on Tuesday, the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 has been amended to make it mandatory for all individuals earning taxable income to file tax return electronically for the tax year 2015, for which the last date is August 31, 2015. Tax experts strongly criticised the move. They said salaried individuals were a soft target, and by forcing salaried persons for filing returns the tax authorities were trying to achieve their desired number.Earlier, the law required a person earning Rs500,000 per year to file tax return electronically. While salaried persons under threshold for income tax payment, ie Rs400,000 were also required to file returns, but it was not mandatory through e-filing.Muhammad Zubair, President, Karachi Tax Bar Association (KTBA) said the changes made by the FBR are disappointing, as this shows they only want to increase the numbers instead of increasing the tax revenue.He said that a large segment of salaried persons fall in the slab of Rs400,000 to Rs500,000, which also includes the lower cadre of any corporate entity. ÔøΩIn some cases even a peon of an entity will be filing tax return,ÔøΩ he added.It is pertinent to mention here that a large number of the salaried class already files income tax returns on an annual basis. According to data obtained from a report of Tax Reform Commission, around 881,262 total returns were filed in tax year 2013, out of which salary returns were 235,117.Rehan Jafri, General Secretary, Pakistan Tax Bar Association (PTBA) criticised the FBR move and asked the authority to first enable its e-portal to handle such a huge number of filings.He said that the last date of filing the income tax return is August 31 and so far the return forms have not been issued by the FBR. ÔøΩIt will create difficulties for taxpayers to file in a short span of time,ÔøΩ he said, adding the FBR should have issued the form on July 1 allowing at least two months for filing preparation.The FBRÔøΩs new online software for filing income tax returns IRIS (Integrated Risk Information System) was criticised last year for deficiencies. Tax experts believe that without addressing the issues it will be another failure for FBR.Shahid Hussain Asad, Member Inland Revenue (Policy) and official spokesman said the measure had been taken to ensure electronic availability of taxpayersÔøΩ data.As per tax laws all the individuals are also required to file a wealth statement along with their return.

"Oil prices extended losses in Asia on Wednesday as dealers worried about ChinaÔøΩs economy following its surprise currency devaluation, while oversupply concerns also added to downward pressure, analysts said.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for September delivery fell five cents to $43.03 while Brent crude for September slipped 35 cents to $48.83 in late-morning trade.WTI on Tuesday sank to its lowest level since March 2009, while Brent also fell in London, after ChinaÔøΩs central bank moved to devalue its currency by nearly two percent against the US dollar.The PeopleÔøΩs Bank of China again lowered the daily fix that sets the value of the Chinese currency against the greenback on Wednesday by 1.62 percent, sending a new shockwave through financial markets.""The Chinese yuan continues to weaken for the second day, which could suggest further weakening of oil prices,"" said Daniel Ang, an investment analyst at Phillip Futures in Singapore.Investors fear BeijingÔøΩs move signalled concerns over growth in the worldÔøΩs second-largest economy and top energy consumer, which came after data published over the weekend showed a slump in Chinese trade.It also pushed up the greenback, which strengthened further against Asian currencies on Wednesday, which hurts dollar-denominated commodity prices by making them more expensive for international buyers.Ang said prices were also under pressure after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) said output in July rose by 100,700 barrels per day from the previous month to 31.5 million barrels per day.""An increase in OPEC production is certainly not ideal for the oversupplied market at this point in time,"" Ang said.The producer cartelÔøΩs refusal to cut its output level despite sagging demand is seen as a reason for a prolonged global oversupply, which has seen prices fall to almost a third of their mid-2014 peak.Analysts have said the move is an attempt by the cartelÔøΩs kingpin Saudi Arabia to defend its market share as it fends off competition from US shale oil.Dealers will next focus on US crude stockpiles data to be released on Wednesday for clues on demand in the worldÔøΩs top crude consumer, Ang said.

"BuzzFeed, the website which lives off viral and ""shareable"" news, got a major boost for expansion plans Tuesday with a $200 million investment from NBCUniversal.The deal with NBCU, a division of the media and cable conglomerate Comcast, calls for ""strategic partnerships"" between the two groups, which could allow sharing of content between BuzzFeed and the vast NBC television operations.The deal values the ""social news"" pioneer at some $1.5 billion, according to several media reports. The companies did not comment on the valuation terms of the investment.""ItÔøΩs a fascinating time for the media industry; social, mobile, digital, and broadcast platforms are converging to create new opportunities to connect with global audiences,"" said Jonah Peretti, BuzzFeedÔøΩs founder and chief executive.The news comes just a week after NBCUniversal announced a similar $200 million injection into another digital news group, Vox Media, and highlights the potential seen in online news as consumers move away from traditional media.""BuzzFeed has built an exceptional global company that harmonizes technology, data and superior editorial abilities to create and share content in innovative ways,"" said Steve Burke, CEO at NBCUniversal.""They reach a massive, loyal audience and have proven to be among the most creative, popular and influential new media players. We are pleased to be making this investment and for our companies to partner and work together.""The investment follows MondayÔøΩs announcement that BuzzFeed would launch a Japanese news website in a partnership with Yahoo Japan, the latest step in a global expansion push.BuzzFeed is one of the largest pure-play digital websites, claiming to reach some 200 million users worldwide.With its recent expansion, the group says some 45 percent of traffic now comes from outside the United States, having launched editions in Britain, Brazil, France, Australia, India, Germany, Mexico and Canada.BuzzFeed, founded in 2006 by Huffington Post co-founder Peretti, was known for offbeat ""shareable"" news but has been investing in new staff and technology as it expands globally.NBCU was created as a joint venture with the NBC broadcast group and Universal Pictures, previously controlled by FranceÔøΩs Vivendi. Comcast took full control of NBCU in 2013.- Profiting from sharing -While BuzzFeedÔøΩs finances are not made public, documents leaked last week by the website Gawker suggested it is making a profit -- some $2.7 million in the first six months of 2014 and $7 million in 2013.Rebecca Lieb, an independent media consultant and analyst, said BuzzFeed ""has successfully captured mass eyeballs, which is difficult in an era of highly specialised and topical information.""BuzzFeed ""is good at picking topics which are light and entertaining and shareable,"" Lieb told AFP.Additionally, she said BuzzFeed has successfully reached younger audiences who often donÔøΩt read newspapers or subscribe to cable television, and that this group is attractive to advertisers.BuzzFeed also has been able to optimise its content by using algorithms that show which stories are viewed and shared most often, and prioritising these items, Lieb said.She added that the website is strong in ""native"" advertising, which includes ""sponsored"" and similar content.The tie-up with NBCU offers potential, Lieb said, such as snippets of Olympic videos which could be offered to BuzzFeed and drive consumers to watch more on television.Kenneth Lerer, BuzzFeedÔøΩs executive chairman, said in a statement that the tie-up could mean ""collaborating on television content, movies, the Olympics, and joint partnerships with ad agencies and brands.""Last year, BuzzFeed said it had secured $50 million in a deal that reportedly valued it at $850 million. But the latest injection vaults it into the club of ""unicorns,"" a term used for startups valued at over $1 billion.Vox is believed to be worth over $1 billion following its recent cash infusion from NBCU.

"Oil prices fell in Asia Wednesday, giving up meagre gains in the previous session as investors await a US inventory report to gauge demand in the worldÔøΩs top economy.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for September delivery fell 17 cents to $42.45 a barrel and Brent crude for October dipped 23 cents to $48.58 a barrel in late-morning Asian trade.Both contracts eked out modest rebounds in closing deals in New York on Tuesday.But analysts said prices were unlikely to stage a sustained rally because the market remains awash with supplies from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), led by Saudi Arabia.Oil traders are also watching a report on US crude inventories in the week ending August 14 due later Wednesday to measure demand in the worldÔøΩs biggest economy and large producer of shale oil.Analysts expect inventories to decline, but also said stockpile levels remain high after a weaker-than-hoped rise in demand during the summer driving season.""Output in the US has turned out to be more robust than many had previously assumed, as shale firms have dramatically slashed costs and increased their efficiency rather than cutting production,"" said Thomas Pugh, commodities economist at research firm Capital Economics.Demand growth is not keeping pace with supply, especially with the slowdown in China, the worldÔøΩs top energy consuming nation and its second-biggest economy.Iran last month also reached an agreement with major world powers to rein in its nuclear ambitions in exchange for the lifting of crippling Western economic sanctions which have restricted its oil exports.""This renewed decline in oil prices has largely been driven by a combination of concerns about demand, notably from China, and continued strong growth in supply,"" said Pugh.""OPEC has increased its output by almost 1.4 million barrels per day since January and the potential return of exports from Iran early next year could exacerbate the supply glut,"" he said.

"Global oil prices hit a new six and a half year low Thursday, nearing the key $40 a barrel level as a surprise rise in US stocks fuelled supply glut fears.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for September delivery sank to $40.21 per barrel, the lowest level since March 2009. It later stood at $40.30, down 50 cents from WednesdayÔøΩs close.Brent North Sea crude for October delivery meanwhile slid to $46.31 a barrel, a point last seen in mid-January and not far off a six-year nadir. The contract later stood at $46.40, down 76 cents.""US stockpiles unexpectedly expanded when the market was looking at a contraction, which heightened the global oversupply concerns,"" said Bernard Aw, a market strategist at IG Markets.""This added pressure to crude prices, and we see WTI drop below $41, heading towards the key $40 level. We could see more downsides, given that the current conditions remain unfavourable to oil.""The US Department of Energy on Wednesday said oil stockpiles rose 2.6 million barrels in the week ending August 14, and reported a 300,000 barrel rise at the closely watched Cushing, Oklahoma trading hub.The surprise jump in inventories at a time when they normally fall added to concerns of a global surplus, particularly as signs emerge that demand is faltering in top energy importer China.US banking giant Citigroup said WTI could fall to $32 a barrel, a level not seen since the throes of the financial crisis, pressured by excess supplies.""Oil balances point to further oversupply throughout 2015 begging the question how low can oil go,"" it said in a market commentary, adding that hitting the 2008 low of $32.40 a barrel ""is a conceivable reality.""But Daniel Ang, an investment analyst with Phillip Futures in Singapore, said he expects WTI to be supported at $40 a barrel in ThursdayÔøΩs trading session.""Technically, we are still seeing a very bearish momentum, however for prices to break below $40 is going to be an arduous task,"" he said.""We see $40 for WTI to be a strong psychological support.""

"The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has initiated a drive to identify income sources of luxurious vehiclesÔøΩ owners to ensure their tax return filings, confiscating vehicles on non-compliance, official sources said on Thursday.The sources said tax officials are obtaining data of registered motor vehicles above 1,000cc to determine the sources of income of their owners to increase filings of tax returns.They told The News that Inland Revenue asked local car assemblers and customs authorities to share the last five-year data of purchased vehicles with the tax department.ÔøΩWe are comparing this with the data provided by the provincial motor vehicle registration authorities,ÔøΩ said a source.The sources said the FBR has started issuing notices to the owners of vehicles and around 422 vehicles have been seized on non-compliance.Motor vehicle registration authorities of various cities have so far shared data of 821,000 registered vehicles above 1,000 CC, while Indus Motors Co Limited, Pak Suzuki Motors Co Ltd and Honda Atlas Motors Ltd have provided the details of 73,200, 153,700 and 45,000 vehicles, respectively.The sources said the customs department will also provide the details of vehicles imported during the past five years, including those cleared under the amnesty scheme announced in 2013.They said a number of smuggled vehicles are being used, especially in rural areas.An official at Regional Tax Office (RTO) Karachi said vehicles were also cleared on fake identity for which customs authorities are responsible.The customs cleared around 51,200 vehicles under the amnesty scheme 2013 and earned the FBR Rs16.2 billion as duty and taxes.ÔøΩThe amnesty was granted on clearance and a vehicle owner is required to file income tax returns and declare source of income,ÔøΩ said the source.However, the FBR failed to identify the real ownership due to apathy of customs department fraught with corruption and misconduct.The Federal Tax Ombudsman, in 2014, released a detailed report on irregularities in clearance of imported vehicles.ÔøΩGranting amnesty to smuggling is counterproductive as it promotes smuggling, emboldens smugglers and contributes to black economy,ÔøΩ the report said.It further said luxury vehicles were mostly smuggled to cater to the upper class, adding that therefore the amnesty was more undesirable and against the national interest.ÔøΩApart from the conceptual irrational and counter-productivity of amnesty for smuggled vehicles, the amnesty scheme 2013 was allegedly misused for corrupt motives by the customs staff for regularising such vehicles as had either not yet arrived in the country or these were not physically presented or actually seized by the customs,ÔøΩ the report said.Besides, many tampered and stolen vehicles might have been granted amnesty due to weak or non-checking of tampering and absence of any filer for stolen vehicles, it said.ÔøΩIt will be difficult to cross-match the data of imported vehicles with those registered with the provincial authorities in such as scenario,ÔøΩ said a source in the Inland Revenue.

"The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Friday warned exchange companies on ÔøΩartificial shortageÔøΩ of the US currency that dropped rupee further to 104 against dollar amid a frenzy in the currency market.ÔøΩThe artificial shortage of the US currency is a major source of concern,ÔøΩ Abid Qamar, the chief spokesperson of SBP told The News. ÔøΩThe State Bank is strictly monitoring the exchange rate movement in the open market and instructed the exchange companiesÔøΩ heads that they should take necessary actions.ÔøΩQamar said the central bank expressed its concerns over the falling rupee value in the open market despite that the bank has allowed exchange companies to import dollars to meet the growing demand for the greenback.ÔøΩ(The central bank) has warned the exchange companies to make all-out efforts for curbing the US currency shortage in the market,ÔøΩ he added.Qamar said recent move in the kerb dollar rate is really a source of worry for the central bank. ÔøΩThe rising supply-demand gap is a source of worry.ÔøΩThe rupee hit 104 against the US currency on Friday at the open market as dollar shortages continued. It was quoted 103.50/103.70 against the greenback.The rupee also breached its support level of 101 and closed at 102.02 versus dollar in the interbank market.The rupee has depreciated 3.5 percent since August 2014. The [interest] spread on buying and selling of the dollar between interbank and open markets has widened to Rs2. The State Bank has clearly instructed that the spread should not exceed 25 paisas.Malik Bostan, President Forex Association of Pakistan said the open currency market was volatile due to rise in dollar demand from Hajj pilgrims and imposition of 0.3 percent withholding tax on banking transactions for non-filers, who are now trading in dollar to avoid the tax.Hajj flights started from August 17 and will end next month. Therefore, Bostan said people have started buying dollar and Saudi Riyal for their journey.Meanwhile, the head of the central bankÔøΩs foreign exchange department, in a meeting with the representatives of exchange companies, directed them to bring stability in the kerb market by ensuring smooth supply of the foreign currencies.Bostan said the SBP ordered the exchange companies, during the meeting, to use biometric verification system in foreign exchange dealings for due diligence of the customer.ÔøΩThe SBP said it would provide foreign exchange to the exchange companies to curb the shortage,ÔøΩ Bostan claimed.ÔøΩIt was also suggested that companies would not sell or buy single dollar without providing the CNIC (computerised national identity card) from the customer.ÔøΩ ",other
"Suddenly the online news business is red-hot. Money is flowing into digital news ventures at an unprecedented pace, as investors anticipate an accelerating shift away from traditional media, and new ways to generate revenue from news.BuzzFeed made news this past week with a $200 million capital injection from ComcastÔøΩs NBCUniversal, and with the announcement of a joint venture with Yahoo Japan for Japanese readers.Earlier this month, Vox Media also secured $200 million from NBCU as the startup seeks to ramp up its news websites including Vox.com, The Verge, Re/code and Bleacher Report.Vox and BuzzFeed joined the club of ""unicorns,"" or venture-funded startups worth at least $1 billion, a group which also includes Vice Media, which unveiled a $500 million funding round last year.The flood of capital to the sector suggests confidence in the ability of digital media to connect with readers -- especially younger audiences which eschew traditional media -- and generate profits, say analysts.""Right now itÔøΩs an arms race. These are companies growing quickly and they have to grow quickly,"" said Ken Doctor, a media analyst with the research firm Outsell.Doctor said a key for these organization is capturing the attention of ""millennials,"" or young adults born after 1980 who rarely subscribe to print publications or cable television, and who get most of their content online.""Marketers have discovered the millennial generation as they get more earning power,"" he told AFP.Interestingly, much of the money flowing into these organizations is coming from traditional media, seeking fresh ways to deal with a transition to digital news.The Murdoch familyÔøΩs 21st Century Fox is an investor in Vice Media, for example, while Time Warner has invested in the online news site Mashable.""ItÔøΩs as much a hedge as anything else,"" Doctor said.""ItÔøΩs a lot of money but not a bank-breaking amount.""Digital eats everything The analyst added that big media groups which saw troubles for print a decade ago are now waking up to digital disruption of television.With consumers slowly moving away from cable TV bundles, ""you can see the fault lines,"" Doctor said. ""Digital eats everything, and television is not immune.""The more successful media startups have found ways to connect and use technology better than legacy firms, say some analysts.""BuzzFeed and Vox and other high-profile startups make the claim they are not just content companies, they are tech companies,"" says Nikki Usher Layser, a journalism professor at George Washington University specializing in digital media.This means ""using data science to understand how information is spreading"" and being shared, she said, to better adapt news feeds and enable advertisers to reach specific segments of readers.BuzzFeed is known for using technology to help understand how news goes viral, while Mashable uses its own system for this. AOL, which owns news sites such as The Huffington Post and TechCrunch, is known for ad technology which measures effectiveness of online messages. Old, new media mergeRebecca Lieb, an independent media analyst and consultant, said she sees benefits from bringing old and new media together.ComcastÔøΩs NBC can reach young audiences by sharing video from programming including the Olympic Games.""WeÔøΩre seeing an era of declining television viewership and increased cord cutting,"" she told AFP.""We have a large number of millennials who are never going to sign up for television packages so IÔøΩm sure NBC is hoping that BuzzFeed can help drive new audiences.""For journalism, the good news is that this trend is driving investment in content, which means more hiring and in-depth reporting at a time when traditional newsroom job losses are accelerating.These large venture-funded news groups have been adding staff, along with smaller ones like Ozy, Fusion and Vocativ. Additionally, eBay founder Pierre Omidyar has pledged to invest $250 million in his online news operations, which include investigative site The Intercept.Doctor said most new media groups spend 60 to 70 percent of their budgets on news and content compared with just 12 percent for the newspaper industry.""These companies have a belief that good content and appropriate content is a business driver,"" Doctor said.Still, it remains unclear if the companies are seeing an investment bubble which gives them unjustifiably high valuations.""We have seen scant evidence of actual return of money to investors,"" Layser said.

"Asian stocks sank deeper into crisis Monday, with Shanghai posting its largest intra-day fall since 2007 as growing concerns about ChinaÔøΩs slowing economy rattled equity investors worldwide. Oil prices fell further after slipping below $40 a barrel for the first time in six years, as weak Chinese manufacturing data deepened worries about the slowdown in the worldÔøΩs number two economy.China-linked shares led the falls, with Shanghai losing more than 8.50 percent at one point before recovering slightly to a 7.52 percent decline in afternoon trading -- wiping out all this yearÔøΩs gains. Hong Kong was down 4.77 percent.Tokyo closed down 4.61 percent, or 895.15 points, at a six-month low of 18,540.68. Seoul dropped 2.47 percent or 46.26 points to 1,829.81 and Sydney lost 4.09 percent, or 213.3 points, to finish at a two-year low of 5,001.3.Regional shares, as measured by the MSCI Asia Pacific Index, slumped to a two-year low Monday after suffering the worst week for three years. Taipei posted its worst ever intra-day slump of almost 7.50 percent.""Today has all the hallmarks of being one of the worst trading days of the past five years,"" said Evan Lucas at IG Markets.""The reaction from Asia today will be symptomatic of the current investor sentiment and belief that a hard landing (of ChinaÔøΩs economy) is inevitable.""AsiaÔøΩs losses followed a steep fall in US and European stocks on Friday, while the price of several commodities plunged to multi-year lows and emerging market currencies took a battering. Global equities have lost more than $5 trillion in value since ChinaÔøΩs shock currency devaluation on August 11 sparked fears its economy is slowing more than thought. Data on Friday showing Chinese manufacturing activity slowed to a 77-month low added to the gloom, signalling that even a campaign by Beijing to stimulate growth by cutting interest rates and boosting lending is not working. Pension fund buying equitiesMore than 750 stocks listed in Shanghai fell by their maximum 10 percent daily limit on Monday, among them many of the brokerages which helped to spark a year-long rally that saw shares soar 150 percent before they collapsed in June. Chinese authorities have since launched unprecedented measures to support shares. On Sunday state media said the huge national pension fund would now be allowed to buy equities, in a fresh bid to prop up the market. The fund, which had some 3.5 trillion yuan ($550 billion) in net assets at the end of 2014, will be able to invest up to 30 percent of that in equities.But local investors fear even BeijingÔøΩs huge firepower will not be enough to stop the rout in Chinese shares, particularly after Shanghai shares fell through the key 3,500 point mark.""This is a real disaster and it seems nothing can stop it,"" Chen Gang, Shanghai-based chief investment officer at Heqitongyi Asset Management Co., told Bloomberg News.""If we donÔøΩt cut holdings ourselves, the fund (managed by his firm) faces risk of forced closure. Many newly started private funds suffered that recently.

"The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said on Tuesday that it is cognisant of the global developments related to markets and is keenly observing its impact on the domestic economy as well. ÔøΩSBP believes that Pak Rupee will remain stable going forward and may even strengthen depending on the relative movement of international currencies,ÔøΩ said an SBP statement today.On Monday (August 24), financial markets across the globe witnessed turbulence and the panic was most visible in the stock markets. Earlier, the foreign exchange markets also had their share in this global turmoil. Since the start of devaluation of Chinese Yuan on August 11, currency depreciation around the globe particularly in the developing countries has accelerated. Many of these countries have allowed their currencies to depreciate primarily to maintain their trade competitiveness against China. Pakistan is also a part of the global economies and cannot remain immune to the developments around the globe. This fact raised expectations about a possible impact on the domestic economy and a downward movement of the exchange rate. As a result on August 24, 2015 Pak Rupee depreciated against the US Dollar to close at Rs 104.50. This translates into a single day movement of the currency by 2.4 percent and a cumulative depreciation of 2.6% percent since the beginning of this fiscal year. It is important to realise that this positioning is driven by international currency movements and not due to any weakness in the domestic economy. The macroeconomic stability achieved through sustained improvements in economic fundamentals is very much intact and these recent developments do not pose any serious challenge to it.ÔøΩOur external sector is robust and reserves are at historically high level.ÔøΩThe statement added that, ÔøΩNevertheless it is keenly watching the international economic developments and its impact on our domestic economy. It is also watching the rent seekers who tend to take advantage of such situations and cause damage to the economy by their speculative activities.ÔøΩ ÔøΩSBP stands ready to take any measure to ensure stability in the markets and will deal with such unscrupulous elements with strong measures.ÔøΩ ",other
"The Asian Development Bank said Tuesday it has approved a new assistance programme for Pakistan worth $1.2 billion annually, to improve infrastructure and create jobs. The Manila-based bank said Pakistan, which has suffered sluggish growth in recent years, was on track to meet targets for cutting poverty. But it said overall development was below potential and further institutional reforms were needed. Tax collection in Pakistan is tiny, severely hampering the governmentÔøΩs ability to manage its finances. A chronic crisis in the power sector -- made worse by poorly targeted subsidies -- is also a major brake on growth. ""The main challenge in Pakistan was to deliver higher, sustained and inclusive growth to cut poverty and create productive jobs for the growing labour force,"" ADB Pakistan country director Werner Liepach said in a statement.

"Oil rose in Asia Thursday as dealers digested a mixed US energy report showing a dip in crude inventories, but barely any decline in production despite sinking prices.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for October delivery gained 86 cents to $39.46 while Brent crude for October rose $1.07 to $44.21 in late-morning trade.The US Department of Energy said Wednesday US crude supplies unexpectedly fell by 5.5 million barrels for the week ending August 21, indicating healthy demand.However, US crude production slipped a scant 11,000 barrels a day in the same period, keeping output above 9.3 million barrels and not far from a decades-high production level.In another bearish indicator, gasoline supplies increased by 1.7 million barrels, adding to concerns of a global glut of energy supplies.Despite the gains in Asian trading, SingaporeÔøΩs United Overseas Bank said the mixed report compounded ""negative sentiment after worldwide falls in equities that helped drag fuel prices to six and a half year lows"".Oil prices hit their lowest levels since early 2009 on Monday over concerns ChinaÔøΩs slowing economy will curb demand for the commodities that have helped drive its growth over the past three decades.The devaluation of the yuan two weeks ago largely fuelled the economic fears that sparked the rout, which also saw heavy losses in most global commodities and equity markets.London-based Capital Economics predicted a rebound in commodities markets, saying that ""much of the bad news was already baked in the cake before the latest sell-off"".""We think commodity prices will now stabilise and perhaps even edge higher and we disagree with the doomsday scenarios for ChinaÔøΩs economy that are currently doing the rounds,"" it said.

Chairman Petroleum and CNG Association Shabir Sulemanji said earlier today that 30 percent of fuel stations in Karachi have run out of petrol and diesel due to the strike, expressing hope that situation would improve by Wednesday.But Geo News correspondent Ali Imran said that by now petrol was available on only about 20 to 25 percent pumping stations ÔøΩ those too most likely on the outskirts of Karachi.

The strike by the Oil Tanker Owner's Association, called to protest against sales tax imposed on transportation of oil, is being seen as the main reason for the shortage which is causing great difficulty for consumers.Experts and observers say the effects of the shortage are exacerbated by pumping stations not keeping enough stock and consumers waiting for prices to go down to refill their fuel tanks.",other

"Pakistan is poised to fetch higher export orders for onion this year after India, its competitor, and Bangladesh returned to the international markets to overcome local shortage in supplies, traders have said.""Pakistan has registered an increase in demand from the overseas markets in the last couple of weeksÔøΩIndia has recently started importing onion from Pakistan via the Wagah border,"" said Haji Shahjahan, an exporter.""Total export of the country would remain steady at 450,000 to 500,000 ton this year, which is similar to the previous year,"" he estimated. The countryÔøΩs annual export size of the commodity stood at 250,000 to 300,000 tons in recent years, he added.Shahjahan said that on an average, some five trucks of onions have been crossing the Wagah border daily to enter into India from Pakistan. Each truck carries some 15 tons of onions.Under these circumstances, prices at Karachi's wholesale market at Super Highway have shot to Rs1,600/40kg of onions from Rs1,000-1,100/40kg a few days ago. Accordingly, the commodity in retail has increased to around Rs40-50/kg from Rs30-40/kg a few days ago.He linked the hike in the prices with the drop in supplies to the market. ""Supplies are sometimes slowed down when the crop finishes in one area and harvesting begins in other areas...These days, onions from Balochistan are available in the markets nationwide."" Sindh would begin harvesting the new crop from October, and will continue in full swing until November-December. The crop would last till April 2016.He, however, said Malaysia, Sri Lanka, and UAE remain the biggest importers of Pakistani onion.Attributing the price fluctuation to the demand supply gap, Shahjahan said Malaysia has been importing 50-60 containers (of 25 tons each) every week, UAE 40-50 containers, whereas Sri Lanka buys 30-40 containers of onion from Pakistan every week. ""On a weekly average, Pakistan exports 8,000 to 10,000 tons of onion,"" he said.Ahmed Ali Baloch, another exporter, said ""I have just received an export order from Bangladesh, and I am evaluating the export price.""Reportedly, Bangladesh usually imports onion from India. The export country {India}, however, is itself experiencing shortage in local supplies and price-hike these days. The situation has also convinced Bangladesh to divert its import orders to other countries.Pakistan, a common neighbour to both the countries, with a local production estimated at 2.5 million tons this year, may help them overcome a part of their local shortages.Egypt, Iran, an Afghanistan may also help them overcome the crises, it was learnt.Baloch added that Pakistan could fetch higher exports than the estimated amount if the government did not set a maximum limit per exporter.

"A strike by freight forwarders and air cargo agents is piling up cargo containers at the countryÔøΩs main port as delays in offloading and taking on new cargo is causing fears that a prolonged stand-off will cost the economy billions of rupees.The strike, observed in protest against eight percent turnover tax, entered the second day on Wednesday, bringing the external trade to nearly halt, said a protesting leader.Pakistan International Freight Forwarders Association (PIFFA) and Air Cargo Agents Association of Pakistan (ACAAP) had announced strike for indefinite period until government resolves all the issues, which include withdrawal of the turnover tax.Farukh Iqbal, chairman of Air Cargo Agents Association of Pakistan (ACAAP) said there was no bill of leading for exporters to ship goods through dry ports/sea ports/airports/bonded container freight station.ÔøΩNo one from governmentÔøΩs side came forward to negotiate with us,ÔøΩ he said.ÔøΩWe have written several letters to the Federal Board of Revenue, finance ministry and Prime MinisterÔøΩs secretariat, but the government was not ready to listen to our grievances.ÔøΩEven various trade bodies took up this issue with the government, which seems to be indifferent to trade and commerce, he added. The cargo agentsÔøΩ leader said since no government official had contacted them on Wednesday they decided to continue the strike.ÔøΩOur members are not responsible or liable for any direct or consequential losses suffered by trade due to strike as government has forced our member companies to take the extreme decision to close businesses in protest against the imposition of this unjust tax, which itself means closure of businesses,ÔøΩ he said.An official at a leading terminal operator of Karachi port told The News that the strike had already slowed down the activities.ÔøΩIf this situation persists for another four to five days the goods waiting for clearance will pile up to create menace,ÔøΩ he said. ÔøΩAnd, it will take 20 to 25 days or even more to do clearance in addition to jack up the operational cost for exporters and importers in form of extra port duties.ÔøΩHe added that the government is not realising the fact.Freight forwarders didnÔøΩt issue any bill of leading for exports and there was no delivery order for lifting the import consignment at terminals. If the situation persists it will create handling issues.Perishable export/import items can be ruined if not cleared on time.The terminal operator said clearing agents and freight forwarders donÔøΩt work on high turnovers and higher taxes can lead to the closure of their businesses.A leading exporter Jawed Bilwani said governmentÔøΩs non-serious attitude to resolve any industry issue is marring trade. The countryÔøΩs exports are already suffering and with the ongoing strike of the freight forwarders and other stakeholders will further hamper the exports.Bilwani said last year good transporters called strike and the government didnÔøΩt seriously take the issue.

"Fragile financial markets are grappling with wild swings in world oil prices, unnerved by uncertainty over global supplies and the demand outlook from China.By the close of business Monday, the price had shot up 27 percent in just three days for the US benchmark contract, West Texas Intermediate for October delivery, rebounding from six and a half year lows.But they skidded again Tuesday when weak Chinese manufacturing data cemented concerns over demand from the worldÔøΩs biggest commodities consumer.Later in the week oil prices got a boost from the European Central Bank, which on Thursday held out the prospect of yet more stimulus for the eurozone economies if needed.By the end of the week, crude oil prices were trading in London on Friday evening barely changed.Brent North Sea crude sold at $49.95 a barrel -- down from $50.17 a week earlier. The WTI contract traded at $46.22, up from $45.22.Crude oil, the world economyÔøΩs most important raw material, has roughly halved in price in a year.""The fall in commodity prices has looked particularly dramatic because it has included oil,"" said Julian Jessop, chief global economist and head of commodities at London-based research group Capital Economics.While many raw materials have been declining in price since 2011 as ChinaÔøΩs booming economy began to slow, oilÔøΩs price had been propped up by a perceived threat to supply after the Arab Spring, Jessop said in an interview.""Once the concerns about the potential threat to supply from the Arab Spring disappeared and were replaced by the reality of massive oversupply because of the shale revolution in the United States and OPECÔøΩs response of keeping production high when people had thought it might cut, then oil tanked,"" the analyst said.Keeping pressure on oil prices, Iraq has managed to boost production this year by 1.5 million barrels per day despite the conflict with extremists including Daesh group and Iran is set to raise exports as sanctions are lifted after an agreement was reached over its nuclear programme.Despite the uncertainty on commodity markets, the price of gold -- a safe haven -- lost its shine over the past week, hurt by a rally in the US dollar.The precious metal also lost its lure as a haven at as volatile Chinese markets took a holiday on Thursday and Friday to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II.On the London Bullion Market, gold was trading at $1,118.25 dollars an ounce Friday against $1.135 dollars a week before.

Tokyo, which is heavily dependent on Middle Eastern oil, has maintained friendly relations with Tehran through its years of ostracism, keeping up diplomatic dialogue that many developed countries cut off decades ago.But Tokyo has reduced its Iranian oil imports in recent years under pressure from fellow developed powers backing the US-led sanction regime. There have also been no new Japanese investments in Iran since 1993, according to official data. There were approximately 30 Japanese firms operating in the country as of July last year, data showed.Iran has meanwhile praised JapanÔøΩs nuclear technology, even after the 2011 Fukushima crisis, and said more investment in IranÔøΩs atomic sector could boost bilateral relations.Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida is also expected to visit Iran as early as next month to set up a bilateral committee to discuss energy and infrastructure development and other economic issues, Kyodo News said.

Dubai had shaken world markets when it signalled that it might default on huge debts incurred after borrowing extensively to build those ambitious projects.Thanks to the robust trade, tourism and transport sectors, the economy has since steadied. ""Residential prices have fallen maybe nine or 10 percent this year,"" said Craig Plumb, Middle East and North Africa research director for Chicago-based investment management company Jones Lang LaSalle.""We expect prices to go down further over the rest of the year,"" saying the decline has ""more to do with what is going on globally. Things like (falling) oil prices and the global nervousness with the Chinese economy slowing.""""The Dubai residential market is very much affected by whatÔøΩs going on in the rest of the world because a large number of people buying here are investors coming from overseas,"" said Plumb.""There is a negative sentiment largely driven by oil prices... It pushed stock prices down and pushed sentiment against the residential market as well.""The city-state, one of seven that make up the United Arab Emirates, is the largest and one of very few markets in the region that has opened up to foreign free-hold ownership. Plumb said prices are likely to fall for 12 more months, while forecasting the drop for this year at 15 percent. London-based property consultancy Knight Frank has reportedly put the annual drop to June at over 12 percent. Cluttons, another London consultancy, expects villa prices to lose up to seven percent in the second half of the year after dropping five percent in the first six months. Signs of price softening had begun to show as a result of strict regulations introduced by UAE financial authorities to avoid a new bubble, including mortgage caps.In particular, they put a cap on mortgage financing at 75 percent for a first purchase and 60 percent for a second one. This priced out of the market those who could not make down payments of 25 percent or more. As a result, Plumb said, prices are not expected to nosedive as they did in the crisis.""We are seeing a much more stable market and that is a sign of better regulation.""Developers undeterredAgainst that background, Cluttons said more than 40,000 units have been announced this year, with in excess of 20,000 to be delivered by 2017. Ziad Chaar, managing director of Dubai developer DAMAC Properties, said ""with 53 billion dirham ($14 billion) recorded transactions in the first six months... we are sure that this market is a good market.""Chaar cited a growing population and healthy economic expansion, including a rising number of tourists and modern infrastructure, in addition to a stable exchange rate and political stability compared with a wider region in turmoil. ""If we did not know that this market is strong, and that there is a very strong demand, we would not have launched these projects,"" he said, pointing to scale models of various luxurious projects. One of the projects on display at Cityscape is Meydan One, which includes plans for the worldÔøΩs highest residential tower, at 711 metres (2,333 feet) high. Dubai is already home to the worldÔøΩs tallest building, Burj al-Khalifa, with stands at 829.8 metres. At foot of Meydan One, a 1.2-kilometre indoor ski slope is set to break DubaiÔøΩs own world record, Ski Dubai, which boasts a 400-metre slope.DubaiÔøΩs Nakheel Properties, developer of Palm Jumeirah and the World Islands, announced that it aims to bring 10,000 units on to the market in the Jebel Ali area. Savills, another British real estate consultancy, ranks the UAE as the world second-best country for residential investment, after only the United States. It said DubaiÔøΩs market has ""matured"" and that softening prices are expected to pick up again in mid-2016, as the country prepares to host the Expo 2020 trade fair.",other
"Traders and business community is observing countrywide complete shutter down strike, halting business activities today (Wednesday) against the imposition of withholding tax on all types of banking transactions.This would be the second countrywide strike on the same issue. Earlier, the business community succeeded in observing the strike across country, pressurising the Federal Board of Revenue to halve the rate of withholding tax on banking transactions, and extending the date of implementation of the said tax.However, a faction of traders refused the FBR incentive, sticking to their single point agenda of withdrawal of the withholding tax from banking transactions, which has compelled the other groups to join hands with them and show their muscle power to the government.On Tuesday, different factions of the traders in two different press conferences announced the complete shutter down strike for today. They said that after this strike, they will announce their future plans of protests and strikes which would be for an indefinite period.They said that businessmen had never refused to pay taxes, but the government instead of taxing those who were already in the net, should bring new people in to the tax net.They said that this tax had not only made life of the traders miserable, but also destroyed the whole banking sector, as it was now facing a collective loss of Rs878 billion.After the traders and business community, the Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) also announced to observe the September 9 strike.",other

The market seems to have shrugged off the weak Chinese trade data and is now looking beyond that for cues,"" Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at IG Markets in Sydney, told AFP.""We might see some movement next depending on how the US stockpile numbers turn out,"" he said.China said Tuesday its exports fell 5.5 percent year-on-year in August while imports plunged 13.8 percent, led by falling commodity prices, adding to worries about the strength of the worldÔøΩs number two economy and top energy consumer.The slowdown Chinese growth, as well as a slew of other weak indicators, have sent panic through world markets, as the country is a key driver of global expansion.In the United States, the Department of Energy will release its weekly petroleum report on Thursday, a day later than usual owing to the Labor Day holiday on Monday.US crude reserves likely rose by 250,000 barrels in the week to September 4, according to a Bloomberg News survey of analysts.

"A mixed reading on Chinese inflation Thursday kept Asian equities traders on edge in fresh volatility Thursday as markets retreated from a two-day rally, while fears of a US interest rate hike saw safe assets advance.Early selling spread through regional exchanges, with Hong Kong and Shanghai seeing hefty losses, despite Chinese Premier Li Keqiang the day before seeking to shore up confidence in the governmentÔøΩs handling of an economic crisis that has sent global markets plunging.A late tumble on Wall Street provided extra reason to run after a report showing a tighter US jobs market increased speculation the Federal Reserve will pull the trigger on a rate rise at next weekÔøΩs policy meeting.ThursdayÔøΩs losses follow thumping gains across the world over the previous two days -- including a 7.7 percent jump in Tokyo Wednesday -- which were helped by Chinese moves to bolster its economy.However, Nader Naeimi, head of dynamic asset allocation at AMP Capital Investors Ltd. in Sydney, told Bloomberg News: ""Markets will remain volatile until the Fed meeting next week.""Investors are again focusing on the potential US interest rate increase and how it would impact emerging markets.""In Beijing, official figures showed the consumer price index (CPI) rose two percent last month, better than JulyÔøΩs 1.6 percent and beating forecasts of 1.8 percent.However, the producer price index (PPI) -- a crucial measure of costs for goods at the factory gate and a leading indicator of the trend for consumer prices -- slumped at its fastest rate in six years.The figures will do little to ease the struggle authorities have in kickstarting the worldÔøΩs number two economy and main driver of global growth as it suffers a painful slowdown.""This is a real problem,"" said Zhu Qibing, a Beijing-based analyst at China Minzu Securities Co.

"Asian markets were relatively calm Friday at the end of a volatile week, with Shanghai and Hong Kong ticking higher after China unveiled a series of steps to shore up its economy, but fears of a US interest rate hike kept dealers on edge.Higher-yielding, or riskier, currencies such as the Malaysian ringgit and South Korean won benefited from a more upbeat outlook, which followed a positive lead from Wall Street, while the Australian dollar edged higher.The safe-haven yen, considered a go-to asset in times of turmoil, retreated.Analysts said world markets seemed to be settling after a roller-coaster ride since China last month devalued its yuan currency, sparking concerns about the worldÔøΩs number two economy -- the main driver of global growth -- and its leadersÔøΩ ability to control the crisis.The broadly upbeat sentiment comes after Beijing sought to reassure investors it was able to maintain high growth, and announced a plan to speed up major construction projects and cut taxes for small and medium-sized enterprises.A set of capital controls to prevent a flight of cash were implemented this week, while analysts said a rise in the offshore yuan Thursday suggested the central bank had intervened to prop it up.Authorities also unveiled a series of measures to prevent huge swings in ChinaÔøΩs stock markets, which have seen trillions of dollars wiped off valuations in Shanghai since it hit a peak in mid-June. Among the measures are a ""circuit breaker"" that stops shares being traded after rising or falling by a certain amount.In early trade, Shanghai was up 0.29 percent, Hong Kong added 1.31 percent and Sydney was 0.37 percent higher. Tokyo pared most early losses to end the morning flat.Juichi Wako, a senior strategist at Nomura Holdings, told Bloomberg News: ""We seem to be forming a bottom, but uncertainty has yet to be completely dispelled, including what happens with US monetary policy.""Global investors are nervously waiting for next weekÔøΩs Federal Reserve policy meeting, with uncertainty over whether it will lift interest rates for the first time in nine years or hold fire owing to the recent market turmoil.A hike in borrowing costs would likely hinder investment possibilities and also fan a flight of capital back to the United States in search of better returns, to the detriment of emerging markets.Hopes that bank policymakers will opt not to raise rates supported US stocks, with Wall StreetÔøΩs three main indexes all ending strongly higher.A less volatile atmosphere saw low-risk assets retreat. The dollar bought 120.82 yen compared with 120.63 yen in New York, while the euro was at $1.1279 compared with $1.1275.And the Australian dollar, which earlier in the week hit a six-year low below 69 US cents, was at 70.72 cents.The ringgit was up 0.13 percent and the won gained 0.82 percent.

"The government believes that coal-based power generation is the best source of energy in the wake of depleting gas reserves.The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) said efforts must be made to change the energy mix towards cheaper fuels.ÔøΩWith the depleting natural gas reserves in the country and relatively longer lead time for the construction of hydroelectric power projects, coal power plants are considered the best option in the short- and medium-term planning,ÔøΩ reads a NepraÔøΩs decision pertaining to the generation licence application of Siddiqsons Energy.NEPRA awarded a generation licence to Siddiqsons Energy Limited for 350-megawatt coal-based thermal facility at Port Qasim with a cost of approximately $600 million.The project is expected to be commissioned by December 31, 2018, while the company is required to provide a certificate on bi-annual basis, confirming that the operation of its generation facility is in line with the environment standards as prescribed by the relevant competent authority.NEPRA said electricity is a fundamental element for the economic growth of any country. The electricity consumption per capita has a strong correlation to the social development and economic indices.ÔøΩIncreasing electricity consumption per capita can directly stimulate faster economic growth and indirectly achieve enhanced social development,ÔøΩ the authority said.ÔøΩIn short, the economic growth of any country is directly linked with the availability of safe, secure, reliable and cheaper supply of electricity.ÔøΩThe authority said for sustainable development, all types of electric power generation resources, including coal (imported/indigenous), hydel, wind, solar and others must be tapped and developed on priority basis both in public and private sectors.The existing energy mix of the country is heavily skewed towards the costlier thermal generation facilities operating on furnace oil.ÔøΩThe import of expensive furnace oil results in depletion of the precious foreign exchange reserves of the country, affecting the macro and microeconomic stability,ÔøΩ read the ruling.ÔøΩAn increase in the consumer end tariff results in higher inflation but it also affects the competitiveness of the local industry with its foreign peers.ÔøΩIt further said it is vital that indigenous and imported coal projects are given priority for power generation and their development is encouraged to reduce the demand-supply gap and to achieve sustainable development.
